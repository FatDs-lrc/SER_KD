We were almost there and now all this is going to hold us up.	3
Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!	1

Which they call the leash.	0
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.	4
You would think.	0
You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way.	0
When I came back from the war, I had a son.	2
I've got those yellowstain blues down from my head to my shoes you should see strong men quail if he should spy a shirt-tail...	0
We will.	0

Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...	3
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.	3
Hey! What's she doing back here?	2
A pleasure.	1

Take me around the block a couple of times.	0
He's with them.	4
Elise?	0
Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child.	5
She went in there to find the Hope Diamond. Just because she came out with a piece of glass doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.	5
You're good, but you're taking on a lot.	3
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.	4
Molly ... people don't study acting ...	0
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?	4
You see my old man he used to drink a lot.	0
Well, that's not a very even trade.	2
