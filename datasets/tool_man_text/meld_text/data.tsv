You must've had your hands full.	0
That I did. That I did.	0
So let's talk a little bit about your duties.	0
My duties?  All right.	2
Now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.	0
I see.	0
But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.	0
Good to know.	0
We can go into detail	0

"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""Hey, you're not Bob."""	0
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.	0
Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this	4
Nobody!	4
Nobody respects the bucket!	4

Nothing!	0
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since.	5
But um, I don't think it's anything serious.	0
This sounds like a hernia. You have to... you-you go to the doctor!	2
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!	5
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!	4

Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.	3
Oh my God, wh-what happened?	2
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!	3
I knew that was him!	4
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.	3
Hey, you ok?	0
I guess.	3
There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.	0
I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.	0
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.	0

This is so much better than the first time we went out.	1
Y'know?	0
That was so awkward, we were really nervous.	0
Didn't you sleep together?	0
Yeah, that really calms me down.	0
And!	1
We have so much in common!	1
She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well that's a	1
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please don't get married before I do.	2
Okay.	0
How does she do that?	2
I cannot sleep in a public place.	0
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.	1
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.	2
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.	0
What's going on with you?	2
I got no sleep last night!	4
Why?	0
Oh, and deaf.	0
So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.	0
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.	0
Thanks.	1
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?	0
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?	2
Breathe, breathe, breathe.	0
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.	2
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?	4
How can you not know which one?	2
I mean that's unbelievable.	1
I mean, was it Gina?	0
Which one is Gina?	0
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.	0
No, no, no, that's Dina.	0
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!	2
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny.	0
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.	0
You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.	0
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.	1
Really!?	2
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.	0
I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.	0
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?	1
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.	5

: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.	0
No, I'm good.	0
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?	2
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so	0
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?	2
Who knows?	0
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.	0
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!	1
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!	1
Yeah!	1
Actually, that can't happen.	0
Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.	0
So it'll be either you two  or you two.	0
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.	3
Yeah, it is.	0
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.	0
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.	3
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.	1
Please!	4
Are you kidding?	4
I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose... I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am.	4
And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.	1
I think you've got concussion.	5
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.	1
You're welcome.  I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?	5
It's worth the pain.  Y'know what, you know what? It's not.	3
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.	2
"I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do""  ""I do""."	1
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.	0
David is going to propose to Phoebe.	1
What?  Why?	2
Chandler, we have talked about this.	4
You are not supposed to give people advice!	4
Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?	4
I	0
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!	4
"She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone"	4
Man, that's some	2
Oh, that's not what you want...	0
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.	0
It-it's great to meet you Paul.	1
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.	0
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.	0
So Ross, what your problem?	4
Eh-wh... Excuse me?	2
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?	4
That's funny. Umm....  It's not funny.	5

Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.	5

Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.	0
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.	0
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.	0
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.	0
What?! You totally get embarrassed!	2
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.	0
Is that so?	0
Yeah.	0
I can't believe it!	2
I did it!	1
I rode a bike!	1
I never thought I'd be able to do that!	1
Thank you Ross.	1
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.	1
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me.	0

I talk to you and nothin'.	4
You look at me, and it's nothin'.	4
Nothing.	4
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.	1
I have a question about this scene.	0
Yes?	0
Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.	0
Yeah.	0
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.	0
Oh, hey, how about this one.	0
Ah, it's says so in the script!	4
Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.	4
It doesn't say that in the script.	4
It does in mine!	4
I can't	4
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.	4
Y'know who has a great video camera?	0
Greg and Jenny?	0
Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.	0
Let's call 'em.	0
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!	1
Hello?  Eighth street deli?	0

Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?	2
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.	0
Sure. So how long you been...	0
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?	0
Since then?!	2
No, it's only been six years.	0
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.	0
...Joe.	0
Y'ever been in love?	0
...I d'know.	0
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.	0
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.	0
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.	2
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?	0
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.	2
Hey, Rach, how was work?	0
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.	0
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.	0
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.	0
I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...	0
Something wrong?	0
No. Nothing.	0
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.	0
Yeah, that's it?	2
Yeah.	0
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!	3
It's not that bad.	0
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.	4
So, you're just Bing?	0
Because we won our apartment back!	1

Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!	2
No they didn't!	1
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?	0
It's gonna be worth it.	0
It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?	0
Women love guys who love babies.	0
It's that whole sensitive thing.	0
Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.	0
Maybe one of them will break away.	0

Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.	1
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?	1
Well, we are great guys.	0
Bye.	0
Well, not really.	0
I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.	0
Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.	4
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.	1
Yeah. What-what should I do?	5
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.	0
I mean what's more important?	0
What people think or how you feel, huh?	0
Ross, you gotta follow your heart.	0
Joey that is so sweet.	1
Hey.	0

No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.	0
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?	4
You had no	4
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.	4
But I told you, I didn't have the time!	4
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.	4
Wh, Ross what do you want from me?	4
You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?	4
I know.	0
Ooh, I have to tell you something.	1
What?	0
But I can't tell you.	0
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.	0
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.	0
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?	0
No.	0
Does it have to do with Joey?	0
No.	0
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?	0
No, but let's come back to that later!	0
Hi!	1
Richard!	1
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.	0
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.	0
Like I have nothing better to do!	0
So what's up?	0
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.	1
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?	0
No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.	1
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?	3
Maybe!  Well! Well...so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts... Oh forget it! I can't!	4
Joey, I am scared to death about this.	5
But I really think I can do it, I'm just gonna need some help.	5
And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.	0
You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.	1
Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?	4
Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!	3
And you're my big brother!	1
I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world.	0
I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad.	0
I was scared of telling you.	5
Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.	5
Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.	3
I want him to have his uncle.	3
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?	3
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!	1
We're gonna be all right. I mean, even if we're not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.	1
That's right! By his uncle too!	1
And by you.	1
Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.	0
Come here!	1
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!	4
I had a really nice time tonight.	1
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.	1
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.	0
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw	2
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.	0
Hi!	1
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!	2
Like it would help.	0
You are so bad!	1
You are!	1
You are!	1
You are!	1
You are!	1
You are!	1
You are!	1
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.	1
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.	0
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.	2
Hi Mom, it's Jill.	0
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!	2
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.	0
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.	0
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.	0
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was	1
Are you seeing anybody right now?	0
Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out.	5
I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!	5
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?	0
Uh-huh.	0
That sounds great!	2
Hey!	0
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.	4
There's gravy?	2
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.	0
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.	0
What are you doing?	0
I think I left a donut up here.	0
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy.	0
Great job team!	1
Tomorrow at 8:30.	0
Phil!	1
Nice job.	1
Stevens!	1
Way to go!	1
Joel-burg, you maniac!	1
I love ya!	1
Bing!	1
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.	0
Of course, you did.	1
Forgot something else too ya bastard!	1
Well, what about you?	0
You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?	0
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.	3
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?	1
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!	3
Now get on out of here, you!	1
Hey Bob.	0
Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?	1
If I see him, I'll ask.	0
Toby!	1
Yeah!	1
Oh then you know each other.	0
We're on a semi-first name basis.	0
What do you think of adding him to our team?	0
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.	2
Really? They love him down on six.	2
But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.	0
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!	1
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?	0
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!	1
What?	2
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.	1
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!	4
So?	0
So... If you wear that you'll make mine less special.	3
"Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say ""I do,"" he's thinking, ""Yeah, I'd do her too!"""	4
Well then we still have a problem.	0
Yeah!	0
With what?	0
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.	0
Oo! You should have one of us do it!	1
Phoebe, we're getting	0
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!	1
I call it!!	1
What?! No! It was my idea!	4
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.	0
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!	4
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!	0
See, I see.... big passion in your future.	1
Really?	2
I do.	0
Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]	1
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.	0
Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.	0
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.	0
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.	0
What?!?!	2
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.	0
You can spill. In the sink.	0
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.	3
I love you, too.	1
Aww, good.  What?	1
What? I'm just said.	3
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.	0
Oh my God! Are you serious?!	2
Uh-huh.	0
I would love to live with you Ross.. that's-that's great! Thank you!	1
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.	0
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!	1
I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.	3
You just saved me!	1
You're my hero!	1
Hero, I uh, I don't know... well, all right.	0
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!	1
Oh please!   You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?	1
No.	0
No, I won't.	0
But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.	0
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!	4
...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?	4
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.	1
Lose the robe.	0
Me?	2
That's great.	1
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?	0
No, no, I'm still working on mine.	0
That's it?	2
Yeah, it was really hard.	3
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.	0
Ok, you weren't there.	4
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!	1
Pretty nice?	0
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.	0
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.	0
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.	0
You gotta take the canoe!	4
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!	0
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!	4
Good for you!!	4
Pheebs?	0
Yeah?	0
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.	0
One ticket to Yemen?	2
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.	0
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.	2
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?	0
Are you travelling with a child?	0
No.	0
All right, y'know what, she's  gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.	0
Okay, but this is the last time.	0
With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.	1
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.	1
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
How's she doing?	0
She?	2
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?	0
I don't know.  I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.	0
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.	0
Excuse me?	2
What?	0
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.	1
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.	0
Well sensitive is important, pick him.	0
Yeah.	0
Jason is not a sissy!	4
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.	4
Hi.	0
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?	0
Yeah.	0
Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter.	0
I mean, I think it would've happened either way.	0
I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.	0
It was an amazing night.	1
It was. It was an amazing night.	1
You think it looked amazing?	3
Do we have a name yet?	0
No, not yet.	0
That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.	0
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.	0
Hello baby girl.	1
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!	1
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over	4
No Rachel! They got here first!	4
Why is Ross doing that?	0
DANGER	5
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!	2
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.	0
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!	1
Really?	2
Yeah! Look!	0
I know.	0
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.	0
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?	0
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!	1
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so	2
Also so	0
"Oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"	0
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!	0
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.	0
About what?	0
He's planning your birthday party.	0
Oh my God! I love him!	1
You'd better act surprised.	5
About what?	0
My surprise party!	1
What surprise party?	2
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.	1
Well, he didn't tell me.	0
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.	0
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.	4
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.	0
Yuh-huh!	4
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.	4
I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.	4
Looks like I was second to last.	2
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.	0
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.	0
Chandler! He's your father.  he should be at the wedding.	4
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!	3
It's not like we run in the same circles.	0
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.	0
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.	0
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.	0
Hello! Who's in there?	0
How ya doin'?	0
Who in the hell are you?	4
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?	0
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!	5
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!	4
I'm not gonna marry Chandler!	4
Not after this!	4
Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.	0
I gotta go.	0
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.	3
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.	0
Okay.	0
So Pheebs, what is the book about?	0
I thought you said you read it in high school.	0
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway... umm, what is this book about?	0
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?	0
Y'know what, actually...  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?	0
I thought you didn't smoke.	2
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?	0
Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?	0
"And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are crazy!"""	2
But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.	0
We get high.	0
Oh, me too.	0
I'm kidding.	0
Oh, me too.	1
Oh, are you sure you're ok?	3

Does it still hurt?	3
Yeah.	3
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.	1
Hi.	0
Hey, how'd it go?	0
Excellent.	1
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.	1
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.	1
You know what? You are right. I	0
Good for you Pheebs!	1
Ok.	0
Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean	0
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!	4
It's 6:00.	0
Hi!	1
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.	0
Handling it?	0
What do you mean, handling it?	1
There's nothing to handle.	1
Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.	0
Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!	4
What?	2
Come on!	4
And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off.	0
I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.	1
What the hell is this?!	2
What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?!	4
This sucks!	4
All right, what's my next present?	0
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?	0
Enhh	0

Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!	2
Excellent hole, Joe.	0
Oh no! No!! My hole!!	2
What?! What?!! What is it?!	2
My drinking?	0
Oh, I must've said that after you left.	0
Said what? Exactly.	5
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.	0
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!	5
If you're gonna get all sensitive about it!	4
I don't want to lose you.	3
What if I, create a position for you?	0
I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.	0
Say more things like that.	1
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.	1
I'd need an expense account.	0
Done!	1
And an assistant.	0
Sophie, get in here!	1
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.	1
Oh my!	2
They're male nurses.	0
Not in my head.	0
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?	1
Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.	1
What?	2
What are you talking about?!	2
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.	4
I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.	0
Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.	0
Umm, why don't you give	0
What?	2
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?	0
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some	0
Yep! There's always room for	0
Joey, how do you make	0
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad	0
Hello, this is Monica...	0

Oh...	0
Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.	0
Thank you.	0
Okay. Let's bring it in.	0
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.	0
Here you go.	0
That almost hit me in the face.	4
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.	0
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.	1
Oh boy, me too!	1
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours	0
Yeah?	5
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!	0
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!	4
That's me! Come on!	1
Okay.  But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.	0
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.	0
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!	4
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.	0
Hi! Nice to meet you!	1
Nice to meet you too.	0
So, are you ready to go?	0
Yeah.	0
Chandler!	4
I'll be right with you.	0
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.	0
Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.	0
You can take it off.	0
Just slice that baby right off!	5
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?	0
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.	0
Well that's not a third nipple.	0
No?	2
First of all, it's on your ass.	0
Well then, what is it?!	2
Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?	0
I'm with Hamilton!	0
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.	0
Umm, this is great wine.	1
It's from France...In Europe...Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.	0
Really?	2
Uh-hmm... Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.	1
I studied for a year in Barcelona.	0
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking	0
I love hiking!	1
Oh that's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo	1
So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.	2
Oh we-we didn't.	1
No-no. We	5
What?!	2
Um uh...We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all.	0
Why?!!	2
Uh well umm...we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this.	0
Oh. Well then shut me up.	0
Just tell me how.	0
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.	5
Let it go, Ross.	0
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.	0
Do you all promise?	0
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?	0
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!	1
Hey, Pheebs.	0
Dear Ms. Buffay.	0
Thank you for calling attention to our error.	0
We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.	0
We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -	0
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the	0
Honey, both yours.	0
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!	1
Yeah? The work problem?	0
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.	1
What problem did you tell him you had?	0
Oh that's not important. The point is, I really... I think everything's gonna be okay.	0
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?	0
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!	4
Very good,  so good.	1
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.	1
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call.	3
I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club.	3
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!	3
Come on! Look where you are!!	1
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.	0
Remember, a virgin for me please.	0
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.	0
Ahh, come on! Y'know what... y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.	0
Well, if you think it will help.	0
No!	4
That was a test!	5
In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!	5
And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice	5
You should! How is she?	2
Ohhh!!	4
I think somebody needs another lap dance.	1
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.	0
You do?	2
You don't?  Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.	2
That and arrogance.	4
Hey.	0
Hey! How was sailing?	1
Wow thanks!	1
Joe?	5
Yeah!	1
Uh, you've had a lot of sex right?	0
When? Today? Some, not a lot.	2
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to... I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn't....	5
There huh... hmm, there-there was an incident.	5
Don't worry about that man, that happens.	0
It's happened to you?	2
Yeah! Once.	0
Well, what'd you do?	2
I did it anyway.	0
Sup? 'Sup dude?	0
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.	5
So you're playing a little	0
Come on man, really how old?!	2
And they knew about it?	2
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?	2
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!	4
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!	4
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?	0
Do you always have to bring him here?	4
I didn't wanna leave him alone.	0
Alright?	0
We- we had our first fight this morning.	0
I think it has to do with my working late.	0
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...	0
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.	0
Oh, that'd be great!	1
Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.	0
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.	0
Check this out.	0
It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!	2
"""It's almost as good as being there."""	0
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!	1
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!	1
Uh, may I help you?	0
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.	0

I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.	0
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a	3
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?	2
Yeah.	0
My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.	0
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.	0
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.	3
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.	1
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.	0
No, I just I think that it's too soon.	1
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.	0
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.	0
And now you want that money back.	2
Exactly.	0

Yeah, yeah, that's her.	0
But y'know what?	0
Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.	3
Why?	0
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.	3
What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!	2
No. No. No. She lives on the	0
No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.	0
And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.	0
You've been counting wrong.	0

Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.	5
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.	1
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?	2

Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!	4
Okay.	0
I'm sorry.	3
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.	2
You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.	5
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.	0
Pete, can I get you something else?	0
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.	0
Haven't you and I covered that topic?	0
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....	0
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.	1
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth.	1
Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?	0
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?	0
I mean really, think about it.	0
Ho-ho, I will.	0

That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!	4
Okay?	4
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...	4
It's not funny!	4
I respectfully disagree.	0
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!	4
Who cares? Nobody reads those things	0
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.	4
I don't have a page.	0
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!	4
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.	1
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?	2
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.	0
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.	3
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?	1
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.	1
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?	2

I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.	0
Hi, here's the deal.	0
We lost a carseat on a bus today.	0
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.	0
Oh, and there was a baby in it.	0
He wants to talk to you again.	0
Hello.	0

So to sum up, I'm Professor Geller.	0
Good evening, sir.	0
My name is Ross Geller.	0
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.	0
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but... I'm sorry.	0
I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you.	1
Man, I wish I was naked.	0
I mean, this-this looks so great.	1
That is how God intended it.	0
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!	4
But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!	4
Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!	1
Okay, you go!	4
My turn? What-what are you talking about?	2

"And he said, ""Laundry?"	0
Is	0
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.	1
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.	4
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.	0
What?!	2
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most	0
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.	4
Me and Chandler?!	2
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.	0

A test?!!	2
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!	1
Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?	0
I'd have to say...the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you're making me eat him.	0
Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? I'm sorry.	2
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.	0
I think it's best sir.	0
But we really do need to find someone up here.	0
The work is starting to pile up.	0
I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.	0
Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em.	0
That's a good one.	0
What does a guy have to	0
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.	0
Hi, Julie!	1
Isn't there a national football league.	0
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.	0
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.	3
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?	1
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.	0
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?	0
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?	0
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.	0
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as too many women.	0

That's	0
Hey, I've been honing!	4
What was with the dishes?	0
Oh, uh..	5
I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?	5
I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.	4
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!	2
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!	4
It creeps me out!	4
I feel like I can't do stuff!	4
What kinda stuff?	1
You cook naked?	2
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.	0
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.	2
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.	0
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.	3
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.	0
You think you know me so well.	4
Well, don't 'cha wanna?	0
Yeah.	0
Okay, well I do know you.	0
That's what I said.	0
Well so?	0
I can't.	3
I can't.	3
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone.	3
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.	3
Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.	0
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?	0
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.	0
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.	1
Nuh-uh.	5
Yuh-huh.	1
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?	2

No.	0
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?	0

Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?	4
That's the rule.	0
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!	4
How'd you get to that?	4
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio	4
You knew about that?	2
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?	0
What do you mean, like, buy it together?	0
Yeah	0
You think we're ready for something like that?	0
Why not?	0
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?	0
Why, are you moving out?	2
I'm not moving out.	0
You'd tell me if you were moving out right	5
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...	0
Aw, I know all about Kip!	4
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.	4
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?	3
Aw, don't do that	3
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.	3
Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.	0
No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.	0
Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.	1
Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm so sorry!	5
Aw forget it, it's from	0
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I'm gonna kill you!!	4
Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.	3
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.	1
Yes, exactly!	1
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!	1
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.	1
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!	2
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?	0
Really?	4
I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!	1
It's	0
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry.	3
You're right.	0
Y'know what?	0
I'm asking you to do me a favor.	0
You are asking me to be your wife!	4
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.	0
Oh my God!	2
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.	1
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?	0
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-	0
#NAME?	0
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.	0
You actually broke her watch?	2
Barry, I'm sorry...	3
I am so sorry...	3
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...	3
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan.	0
Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea.	1
Okay, okay, bye	0
So what are they doing?	0
I don't know, something girlie.	1
Hey, you're early.	0
What are you doing with the lamp?	2
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.	0
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.	0
You're disturbing my oboe practice.	4
You don't play the oboe!	4

Go!	4
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?	2
I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit.	4
I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.	0
Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?	2
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?	0

You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.	2
I did.	0
Oh.	3
Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here... but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?	5
Sometime?	0
Maybe?	0
Yeah, maybe...	1
Okay... okay, maybe I will...	1
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.	0
Well, you're amazing.	1
Oh no-no-no.	0
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?	2
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.	0
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.	1
Oh, I don't know.	5

Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....	1
Wow! This girl is good.	2
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.	4
I like her.	0
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?	0
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.	0
Look at you. All jealous.	4

Hmmm... this is so nice.	1
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.	0
OK.	0

Everything was delicious!	1
Thank you!	1

We did?	0
You owe me 20 bucks.	1
Thank you. Thank you so much!	1
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.	0
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?	2
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?	4
All right, I'm nine years old.	0
Oh, I hate this story.	3
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.	0
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.	3
Oh my god.	2
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.	3
Hey, who's this little naked guy?	2
That little naked guy would be me.	0
Aww, look at the little thing.	2
Who are those people?	2
Got me.	2
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.	0
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?	2
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?	0
Looks like a fun gang.	0
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!	1
So, what's this about?	1
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.	0
No.  This is my red sweater.	0
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.	5
What's going on Rach?	1
Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?	5
Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called.	1
I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together.	1
Oh, it's just not the right time.	3
It is the right time.	1
Okay.	0

So what, so what you saw him with a girl?	0
Who cares?!	4

Oh, that's Ross's.	0
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.	2
Remembered what?	0
It was like months ago.	2
We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.	3
Oh!	2
I can't believe he remembered!	2
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.	2
I can't believe he did this.	2
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?	0
What did you just say?	2
F-hah.... flennin....	5
Oh.... my God.	2

I do not always have to be... okay, okay.	4
Jurassic Park	0
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.	5
Maybe we should check the trash chute.	0
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.	0
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.	0
Hey!	0
There he is!	1
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!	4
Just, y'know out.	0
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!	4

She's sleeping.	0
Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?	0
Well, the old lady died.	3
And how do I know?	0
Her dying wish was for one last kiss.	0
But I don't care,  because you got the apartment.	1
Yes!	1
Isn't that great?	1
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.	0
Wow, that's great.	1
Oh, yeah!	1
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.	0
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.	0
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.	2
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know.	0
You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.	0
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.	0
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.	1
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right.	0

Isabella Rosselini.	0
Are you serious?  Oh my God.	2
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.	4
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?	0
Yeah, maybe.	0
What you don't think I'd go up to her?	0
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.	0
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.	4
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.	0
Okay, hold my crawler.	0
Okay.	0
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?	2
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.	1
Okay, that's, that's enough.	0
Won't you dance around with me.	0
A-ha!!!	2
Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies!	1

Left!  Thank you.	1
You're welcome.	0
Ross!	2
Joey!  We should just switch.	0
Yeah absolutely!	1
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.	3
Oh that's all right!	1
Y'know, I ended up having a really good time.	1
Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.	1
So what was it for anyway?	0
I wanna say a disease.	0
Hey!	2
Hey!	2
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on	0
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!	2
Oh-oh Professor Geller.	0
Ahh, to be 13 again.	0
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?	0
No! He blew us off!	4
What?!	2
I know!	2
I can't believe it.  Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.	4
Can I tell you something? Me too.	4
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him	4
Ooooh! Freeze him out.	1
That's right!	1
I like it!	1
Doorknob?	0
Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.	0
Oh good.	1
Look, I...  Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.	5
So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet.	3
It's-it's too soon.	5
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.	2
No. I think you misunderstood what	2
You are so adorable.	1
That! Let's talk about that.	1
Hey!	1
How do you feel?	0
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.	0
Okay, so I	0
And protected them from a tornado?	0
Oh my God.	2
I know, the babies are asleep.	0
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!	2
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!	1
But my apartment!	2
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.	0
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out.	0
Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!	0
When will that be?	0
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!	4
Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!	1
What?! It is?!	2
It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.	1
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?	1
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping	1
A dreamless sleep.	0
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!	1
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!	0
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.	0
Okay.	0
When are you coming home?	0
What? Guys, I'm not.	2
C'mon, this is us.	0

Waitressing?	2
Okay, I'm not just waitressing.	0
I'm..	0
I, um...	0
I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh...	0
I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.	3
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?	0
So, um, will you bring the truck?	0
I'll even let you ring the bell.	0
Oh, my god.	2
See, there you go, the cleansing works!	1
They're nice guys.	0
Oh, they're firemen guys.	1
Your son.	0
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.	4
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.	0
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,	2
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.	4
I got it.	0
I got it.	0

All right, that's it. I want both of you out.	4
Why?	2
He started it!	4
No, you started it.	4
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.	4
Now go!	4
Thanks a lot.	4
See what you did.	4
Yeah, listen...	0
Out	4
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?	1
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.	0
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.	2
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.	0
Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.	0
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.	0
Boutros Boutros Gali.	0
He says he was too.	0
Interesting.	0
So I was wondering....	0
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.	1
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.	1
So you're a chef?	0
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.	1
Oh, really.	2
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?	0
Well, I was having a conversation.	0
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.	4
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?	4
That would be great. Thank you.	0
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.	0
When did that happen to you?!	2
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture... I didn't have my camera!	0
Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.	1
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.	4
Here, I'll get it.	0
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.	0
Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.	1
Oh, great!	2
Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!	1
That was unbelievable!	2
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.	3
I don't believe they're brother and sister.	2
They're brother and sister!!!	2
Action!	0
I found the picture!	4
What picture?!	2
The picture of my wife! In your pack!	4
You went through my personal property?	4
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!	4
Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!	4
Cut! Wonderful!	1
Great scene yeah?	1
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.	1
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.	0
I know.	0
So Chandler, your parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.	1
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.	0
I remember when we first got engaged.	1
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.	0
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know how that happened.	1
What a sweet story.	0
What?! They wanted a scary story!	2
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.	1
What?	2
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.	5
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?	2
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.	0
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,	0
Did that!	1
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.	0
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!	2
Was it not pain-free?	2
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.	0
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.	4
But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.	0
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!	2
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.	0
One, two, three, four!	0
You know the song! Sing along!	1
So?	0
No!	3
Oh my God! That's David!	2
David who?	0
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!	3
Oh my God!	2
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.	0
Phoebe?	2
David!  What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?	2
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm,	0
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?	1
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.	0
Yeah.	0
Yes! Santa's coming!	1
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.	3
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?	0
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides	0
Whatever.	0
Okay, Mon, back me up here.	0
Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?	0
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?	0
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.	3
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal.	0
Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it.	3
Y'know, hey I understand.	0
Y'know?	0
Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right?	0
So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool.	0
I'll see you tomorrow.	0
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.	0
You did look like an idiot.	1
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.	0
All right?	0
"Remember when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"""	1
"And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?"""	1
Yeah that's the same.	0
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.	3
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?	0
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.	3
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.	0
Y'know, for me anyway.	3
And of course, the Indians.	3
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!	4
Hi, guys.	0
Hi! Phoebe.	1
Hi Phoebe.	0

Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.	1
I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.	3
Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!	1
No leg-chewing for us sir.	0
Oh well, give it time.	0
So the divorce, the marriage, we've got a lot to celebrate.	1
How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?	0
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.	1
They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!	1
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow!	1
Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow.	0
No.	0
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs	0
How many times have I told you guys, you	0
Hi Chandler.	0
Hey!	0
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.	0
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.	3
William Sonoma	0
Expect it in 4-6 weeks.	0
Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.	0
Yeah, so?	0
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.	0
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.	0
Why?	2
Why?	0
What's your point?	0
So uh, what's your name?	0

Yeah, big fan.	0
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?	1
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.	1
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?	0
Ahh, nooo!!	1
Oh, great!	1
Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery.	0
I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.	0
You're a genius, Ross.	1
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?	0
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.	0
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?	3
Yeah, okay, bye.	0
So I'm gonna take off then!	0
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.	2
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.	1
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.	0
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.	0
Yeah, sure.  All right, whose court is the ball in now?	0
I thought there wasn't a ball?	0
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!	0
Rachel, this is my friend Tom.	0
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?	2
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.	1
So you work at	0
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!	0
I'm sorry?	2
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy.	0
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.	3
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!	1
I think I need a drink.	0
Yeah!	1
Hey, Pheebs?	0
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!	4
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.	3
And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.	0
You really think I'm ready?	2
Uh-huh!	1
Wow! Cool!	1
Was the chord at least right	0
No!	4
Well, this has been fun.	0
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.	1
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.	0
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457.	0
And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.	0
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....	0
I'm really glad we came.  You're so pretty. I love you.	1
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.	0
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office.	0
What are you doing?	0
I'm sorry.	0
But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.	0
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.	0
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?	0
I don't have ten minutes!!	4
What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?	0
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!	4
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.	3
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.	0
Yeah, but wait...	0
Good bye!	0
Actually, that's our three hole punch.	0
Oh yeah? When?	2
I'll tell you what.	0
When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?	0
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?	2
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.	0
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?	4
No, no, no.	0
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?	4
Uh, uh.	0
Well?	2
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!	2
Hey.	0
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.	2
Did you go home and change?	2
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?	0
No, I haven't seen him.	0
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?	2
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?	0
Yeah, why?	0
No reason.	0
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!	1
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?	2
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!	1
Yeah, that's her.	0
Thank you.	0
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!	2
Y'know what would work?	0
Stop making candy!	4
You mean they like you.	0
Maybe.	0
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?	2
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?	4
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'	4
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?	2
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!	1
Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!	1
What? We could do it!	2
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.	1
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.	0
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8	0
I can't do it!	3
Now you do that, you're on TV.	0
Hey!	1
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...	0
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?	0
"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."	0
Well, I like it. Here you go.	0
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?	4
Oh, I embarrass you?	2
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?	0
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?	0
They're all tourists.	0
Oh yeah?  If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.	0
Good choice.	4
Thanks.	1
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!	4
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?	2
What?	2
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.	4
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my	0
Whoa, whoa, whoa.	2
You don't even know me...	4
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.	2
What?	2
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.	3
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...	3
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?	0
Oh yeah.	0
Okay, forward. Forward... Stop!  Okay, back... Stop!  Okay, forward... Stop! Stop! Stop!	0
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.	0
Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.	0
You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.	0
Okay?	0
All right, here we go.	0
Haul ass!!!	0
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.	0
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...	0
...and live forever as a machine!	1
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?	1
You and I, we're interfacing.	0
Yeah, I gotta go.	5
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!	1
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.	0
Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.	0
See?	0
"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."	5
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.	0
Oh, I should go, too.	0
Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.	0
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.	4
"And she was like ""Oh, don't worry!"	3
I asked him.	0
"He's totally ok with seeing you!""."	4
So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!	1
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!	4
Exactly!	0
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!	0
I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,	4
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.	0
Ok, that'll be great!	1
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.	1
Hello Skidmark.	0
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.	0
It's pretty clear.	0
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.	0
That's why you broke up with me?	2
You-you-you didn't know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!	3
Ni-chou chi-ma!	1
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....	2
Hi everyone.	0
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.	0
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.	0
What did, what did he say?	5
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.	0
So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.	0
Oh, great!	1
We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.	1
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.	1
"All I could think of was y'know, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""	1
And did he?	0
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.	1
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.	0
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.	1
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.	1
Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again, am I?	3
Oh my God!	2
I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!	3
I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up!	2
I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.	3
You'll have a last kiss.	0
Thank you so much for coming back over.	1
Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.	3
I know Mona, just hear me out.	0
First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.	0
You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.	0
Focus.	0
Okay. Um...But... Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are	0
All right where's that turkey!	0
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!	2
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!	1
No.	0
No!	4
Oh, would you look at that Monica?	1
I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.	1
Okay, I'm next.  Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!	4
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.	1
Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!	4
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?	0
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.	0
Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.	0
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!	1
I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!	3
Or Friday with no two pizzas!	3
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just... there's gonna be a ton left over.	3
No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!	1
All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?	0
That's right!	1
Cause I'm a Tribbiani!	1
And this is what we do!	0
We can eat!	1
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.	2
Look at this!	1
Oh! You have a window!	2
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...	1
Oh look! That guy's peeing!	2
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?	4
Okay. Let's use this brush.	0
Okay. This stuff?	0
Yeah.	0
All right.	0
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.	0
Okay-Dokey	3
Where exactly is your zoo?	0
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.	0
Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?	0
Yes.	0
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?	0
No-no, he's, he's very docile.	0
Even if he were... cornered?	0
Well I, I don't know. Why?	0
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?	0
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...	0
How about a hammer, or a small blade?	0
Otherwise it's just cruel.	0
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.	1
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...	0
...He's in.	0
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!	1
I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.	0
My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.	0
Really helped speed the process along!	1
Janice!	2
You're not... gone?	2
Sid is still in his room.	0
I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.	1
So did you do it?	2
Did you make your deposit?	0
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!	1
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?	5
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.	1
Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.	0
Phoebe, where's your purse?	5
No, no! Give it to me!	4
You can't have it.	4
Give it to me!	4
No	4
I'll go in there.	4
Oh yeah.	4
Phoebe come here	0
Haha!	1
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!	4
I just had sex.	0
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?	2
Well, you never told me how old you were.	0
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...	1
Don't say it.	5
...in love with you.	1
Really?	2
Sorry.	3
Well,fall out of it.	4
You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.	4
Oh god, oh god.	1
Who?	0
That's right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!	3
Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?	0
You. Like you haven't done enough.	4
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.	0
I mean I wish I were a seahorse.	0
Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies.	0
And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.	4
God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!	1
Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end	0
Oh Phoebe, that's a great story.	0
Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea?	3
Oh God, get out!	4
Get out!!	4
Get out!!	4
Get out!	4
Let's.	0
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.	1
Oh my God....What's he gonna do now?	5
I can't watch!	5
Oh.	0
Seriously, how can you watch this?	3
Aren't you scared?	5
Terrified.	5
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!	1
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.	0
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?	2
Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.	0
I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.	0
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I	0
Fine! Maybe I will too!	1
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.	5
You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!	5
MY SANDWICH?!!!	4
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!	4
What's the matter, Pheebs?	0
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!	4
What?!	2
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.	3
She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is.	3
She knows, and she won't tell me.	3
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!	3
Yeah, well, don't 'Aww Pheebs, that sucks!' me yet.	3
Where ya going?	0
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.	0
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.	5
Well, are any of those people here?!	4
Oh my God, so do I!	2
I knew it, wow!!	2
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?	0
Ohh, so cute.	1
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.	4
I know. I'm mad at me too.	4
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.	0
Hey! Me too!	2
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.	3
Ok, you can do this.	0
It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.	0
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.	0
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.	3
All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.	4
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!	2
Really?  My God, he's really cute.	2
Go for it.	0
Phoebe, I'm engaged!	2
I'm just saying, get his number just in case.	0
But no: Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.	0
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.	1
I did, but that was really fun.	1
Hey.	0
Chandler. I sensed it was you.	0
What?!	2
Unagi. I'm always aware.	0
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?	1
What's up?	0
I can't figure out what to make Monica.	0
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.	4
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?	5
Y'know what?	0
She'd-she'd love this.	0
Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8.	0
I made it in the sixth grade.	0
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.	0
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.	0
But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.	1
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.	0
Why not?	0
"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."	0
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!	4
He might still show up.	0
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.	4
Is that all?	0
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?	3
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.	0
Um, it's going to be a small ceremony.	0
Uh, tiny!	2
We're not even sure why we're having it.	0

It's so hard!	3
Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a... ah-ah!	3
Paper cut!	3
Now, have you told anyone else?	0
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.	0
You told me.	2
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.	4
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.	2
Me too.	0
Hey.	0

I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!	5
You slept with the stripper?	2
Of course!!	5
What difference does that make?!	4
Well, I'm just... if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!	4
Joey, do you have a minute?	0
Dude, what am I gonna	5
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.	4
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!	5

Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have	0
What-what is it, what is it?	0
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.	2
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!	5
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!	4
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?	2
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone	5
I'm not listening to you!	4
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!	1
Hey, come on now!	4
All right, what are we havin'?	0
Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.	0
I'll take those to go.  For the kids.	0
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?	0
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn't have said.	4
But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.	0
Understood. So, what'd you say back then?	0
Well, I said that I	0
Ha!	0
So you like the drums!	1
That's, that's great!	1
Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.	0

So, yay!	1
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...	0
Tequila!!	1
That's fun.	1
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?	2
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.	3
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.	4
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.	5
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.	4
All right that's it, school is in session!	0
My God! Is this a gym card?	2
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.	0

You don't think I've tried? You think I	1
Who is Maria?	0
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.	1
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?	0
No!	4
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?	0
Oh no, you'll have to come.	5
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.	0
Exactly! Because it's in the past!	4
Anybody gonna eat that?	0
Pheebs!	1
Hey!	1
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?	0
Yeah!	0
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!	2
I know. They were mine.	0
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.	0
I'm wearing his briefs right now.	0
That's...kinda hot.	2
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.	1
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.	0
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.	1
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.	0
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear!	0
I don't think you could ever do that.	0
Hey! I	0
Lusts of the flesh.	0
What?	0
I don't know.  A cowboy theme?	0
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?	0
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I... It's beautiful I love it!	1
Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.	0
Hey!	1
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?	0
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my  breast?	0
It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don't worry. It'll happen.	0
Yowza	4
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.	0
Dear Lord.	2
I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?	0
Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?	0
She looks scared.	0
Doesn't she  look scared?	0
You know, I don't really know her.	0
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?	0
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.	0
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?	0
"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the ""a-gogo."""	0
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.	0
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...	3
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.	4
The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.	0
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...	4
Pathetic mess?	0
I know, but... come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.	0
I'm thinkin', cha-ching!	1
Thanks.	0
Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.	0
You're doin' this.	0
Hi. She said yes.	0
Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?	1
"""Happy birthday to you!"""	1
You're paying for that.	0

You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.	0
Damnit!	4
Rach? Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?	0
Well yeah	0
Oh wow!	2
I mean, wow!	2
I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!	0
Really?!	2
"Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!"""	1
Oh so-so not really never.	0
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.	0
I mean after all we've been through, I just... y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.	0
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.	0
Oh-ho, and mine!	1
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.	5
Well...I only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.	0
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?	3
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!	3
Chandler?	0
I-I'm sorry?	3
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!	3
Oh yeah?	3
I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.	0
I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk.	3
Hang-hang on.	0
Hey everybody!	0
Uh, I'm gonna kill myself!	3
I got nothing.	0
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!	2
I didn't know he could get me fired!	2
What am I going to do?	5
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.	0
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.	5
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!	0
That's not a bad idea.	0
Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.	0
Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.	1
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?	0
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.	3
Yeah, you wish.	0
"""You wish."""	1
Why are you yelling?	1
Whoa, that	0
Whoa-whoa, what is it?	2
Well... It's a date.	0
A date?!	2
No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!	2
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.	3
No, I'm gonna!!	4
That's right!	4
Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl!	4

Oh God.	2
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?	5
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.	3
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?	0
Oh.	3
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'	5
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.	4
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.	0
Hey!	2
Hey.	0

Oh yeah, I'd love that.	1
Oh, great! Me too.	1
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.	0

Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.	1
I want you close enough to smell the blood.	1
What do you think?	0
Okay to come in?	0
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.	0
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?	0
What?!	2
I'm the ruptured spleen.	3
Why would you do that?	1
Because you shouldn't be with him.  You should be with me.	3
Really?	2
When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!	3
Look, things like last night they don't just happen.	0
Or at least not to me.	0
Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.	0
Chandler!	2
"I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a ""doctor..."""	3
There was just one woman, wasn't there?	0
No, there were two.	0
Including me?	2
Oh yeah.	1
Hey!	1
Welcome back!	1
Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?	1

Why?	2
Uh, the sex.	0
What sex?	2
Our sex.	1
We didn't have sex.	2
Well if I didn't have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like	0
Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.	2
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.	3
I'm your mother.	0
Ehh?	2
Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler...	0
Hi there.	0
...and he couldn't let it go, and... I don't really know what happened with that either.	0
And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.	0
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don't know what happened there either...	0
Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.	0

Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.	3
Sorry.	0

Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay.	0
Oh, thank you.	0
That is so sweet!	1
Yeah.	0
No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.	4
Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself.	0
It's Joey right?	0
Yeah.	0
Wait a minute!	2
No!	4
I'm the nice one!	2
I'm the one who danced with the kids all night!	2
How...How small are your feet?	0
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.	0
You mean Dr. Geller?	0
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.	2
Oh, he won't sit here.	0
Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.	0
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.	1
Okay.	0
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.	3
Oh yeah man.  Joey.	0
Hey.	0
Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it.	0

I'll talk to you tomorrow.	0
I should uh, probably go.	0
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.	0
I forgot my purse.	0
Oh.	0
No, I really did forget my purse.	0
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.	0
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.	1
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.	0
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?	0
....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?	2
I spelled out boobies.	1
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?	0
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.	0
What?	2
No.	3
No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.	4
It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool.	5
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!	3
Oh God!	3
So, how many have you sold so far?	0
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!	2
Oh my God, how did you do that?	2
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!	1
That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.	1
I am selling cookies by the case.	1
They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'	1
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....	0
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?	2

Yeah but you don't need... ... What is this?	2
Thread!	1
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?	1
What disposable cameras?	3
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?	2
No you didn't.	0
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said	2
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.	0
"And then you said, ""Why do they call it a check?"	0
"Why not a Yugoslavian?"""	0
Yeah, then you did that.	0
So you don't have the cameras?!	2
No. Sorry man.	3
So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!	2
Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.	0
Great.	4
In-in three minutes.	0
Uhh, Rachel, my parents	0
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you.  Hello.	1
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.	0
What?	2
This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not... that's-that's not what it is.	1
See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually.	0
It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at	0
Maybe in L.A?	0
Yes!	1
There you go.	0
So, have you kids eaten yet?	0
Well, we were going to do that after... I mean umm, next.	0
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?	0
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.	0
So... We go eat.	0
Yes.	0
You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.	0

Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?	1
This game makes no sense!	4
Y'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.	1
Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.	0
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.	0
Let me think. Let me think... Oh! I don't care.	4
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.	0
Either, it makes no difference.	0
Choose, you jackass!	4
I'll take a card.	0
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!	1
What?!	2
This game is kinda fun.	1
You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you	0
I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.	0
Hello?  Oh, hi Ross!  See? Other people call me!	2

Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you? Nothing?	4
No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care... I-I love Rachel.	5
What?!	2

All right, bye-bye.	0
Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.	0
We'll give you Janice.	0
"I miss Janice though.  ""Hello, Chandler Bing."""	0
"""Oh, my, god."""	2
"""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"""	1
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.	0
We won. We won!	1
Mr. Heckles.	0
How did this happen?	0
He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand.	0
That's terrible.	4
I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me.	0
Sure, you coulda. You never know.	0
You never know.	0
Oh, I'm sorry.	3
Where's Chandler?	0
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.	0
I'm free! I'm free!	1
That oughta do it.	0
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.	3
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?	2
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.	0
I didn't know there were docks.	2
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
Aww, is it broken?	3
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.	1
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?	0
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.	3
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.	4
What is this? Fruit?	2
Monica's making jam.	0
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?	1
Because the kids need new shoes.	0
I'm going into business people.	0
I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.	0
I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.	4
What's the opposite of man?	0
Jam.	0
Oh Joey don't!	5
It's way to hot.	4
This will just be my batch.	0
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?	2
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.	0
What? Mine aren't tinted.	2
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?	0
I will have one.	0
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.	0
No, no, it's just my tooth.	3
All right I'll have one.	0
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.	0
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.	5
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.	0
Why? Why can't you go to him?	2
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.	4
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.	1
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!	2
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.	0
And all these people actually died?	2
Yes, while I was in the chair!	3
That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!	0
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.	0
It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.	0
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.	3
Hello?	2
Ross.	0
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.	3
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.	1
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.	1
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?	3
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.	3
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.	3
So, let's go.	0
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.	0
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.	0
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.	0
Okay, I've got three of my five.	0
Three of your five, what?	0
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.	0
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.	2
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.	0
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?	0
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....	1
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.	2
Susan Sarandon.	0
And!! Isabella Rosselini.	1
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.	1
So?	0
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.	0
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.	0
Oh that's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?	3
Y'know what I think it is?	0
I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.	0
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!	3
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.	0
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.	3
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.	0
What?	2
Ten centimeters, you're about to become a mom.	0
My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!	2
Are they here yet?	0
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?	0
Ok.	0
Hi.	0
May I see your boarding pass?	0
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.	0
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.	0
No, I know, but I... he just went on.	0
He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...	3
No no no! Federal regulations!	4
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is	0
Alright. What's the message?	0
Uh... I don't know.	0
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.	0
What?	0
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.	0
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!	2
There's no Rachel!	4
Here's the thing, Janice.	0
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.	0
I'm like the bing, bing, bing.	4
You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.	0
Ow!	2
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?	4
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.	3
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.	3
Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?	2
Oh, I don't know, a million?	4
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.	0
I'm fine.	0
All right.	0
I'm not fine. Here she comes.	5
Wait here. Breathe.	0
How do you do that?	2
It's like a gift.	0
We should always always break up together.	0
Oh, I'd like that.	0
You win.	4
Well, what did you have?	0
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six.	1
That my friend is D-Cup.	0
Okay, now much have you won so far?	0
Uh,  wow, 700.	2
Not 700 exactly?	2
Yeah.	0
Double it!	1
What?	2
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.	0
Really?	2
Hey, I didn't make up the rules.	0
Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.	0
Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.	0
Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get... No way!	2
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.	3

Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?	4

Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!	1
Yeah, all of us! All day!	1

What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?	4
"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!"""	4
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.	4
Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!	2
Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just... y'know... stop it!	4
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.	3
Is she in there?	0
Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her.	0

Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.	0
Hey he's wearing a sweater.	2

And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.	0
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...	0
Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?	0
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.	3
Oh, it's okay.	0
No, it's still wet.	1
Let me get it out before it sets.	0
Ooh, I have something you can wear.	0
Here.	0
Oh umm, I-I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.	3
No-no that's a man's shirt.	0
It's awfully pink.	0
Oh, it's perfect!	1
How about you?	0
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.	0
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.	0
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?	2
Let's get the show on it!	1
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.	0
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.	0
Closer than here?	0
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, let's skedaddle.	0
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.	0
Okay, your highness.	0
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry.  That's okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!	2
So how did you know I was even here?	2
Your mom called me. So is this her?	0
No, this is a loaner.	0
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.	0
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?	0
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.	0
Yeah, they're not so bad.	0
I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm	0
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.	2
It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.	3
All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.	5
I just called a friend of mine.	0
Yeah?	2
I think I may be able to book	0
Really?!	2
What is it sweetie?	1
There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.	3
I'm sorry daddy.	3
I don't believe this!!	0
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.	5
Stay calm?!!	4
How do you expect me to stay calm?!	4
This is unacceptable Rachel!	4
And I wanna know why?!!	4
Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?!	4
That's it!	4
Is that it?	4
Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.	3
So, you're like a zillionaire?	2
And you're our age. You're our age.	2
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.	0
What like Pete Dakota?	0
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.	0
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.	0
That's not a state Joe.	0
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?	0
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.	0
Okay.	0
You're our age!	2
So ah, we on for tomorrow?	0
Absolutely!	1
Now get out of here you!!	1
Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him!	4
Look, is there something wrong with me?	3
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future?	3
Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on!	3
I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?	3
No.	0
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.	0
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, 'Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,' remember?	0
And then, and then, you turn to me and say, 'Nah, let's just hang out at your place.' Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.	1
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?	0
You know what else I'm not gonna miss?	4
"""I'm Monica."	4
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.	4
"Even if people are on it!"""	4
"""Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"""	4
"""I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"""	4
Hey! I call her!	1
"""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"""	4
"""Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend!"	4
"So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"""	4
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.	0
Item J437-A, color: winterberry.	0
Hi umm, listen come here, come in.	0
I'm so-so sorry about yesterday.	3
I-I'm really sorry.	3
It's just that I	1
Listen Ross, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.	0
You do?	2
Yeah, you still have feelings for me.	3
And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.	1
And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can't.	3
It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just... It just wasn't meant to be.	3
Oh God you're right.	1
Ross, we...we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?	3
No.	0
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.	0
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.	0
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.	0
Gimme this.	0
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.	0
Brides magazines?	2
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.	0
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.	3
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.	2
I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't.	1
Right?	1
I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.	1
Oh my God.	2
I know.  I need more pie.	0
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?	0
You didn't break up with that fireman?	2
No, that was my way of telling you.	0
Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.	0
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.	0
Wow!	2
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.	0
So then, are you going to dump Jason?	0
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so's Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?	0
So... It's really just about the math.	0
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.	0
Ok, look! Enough is enough!	4
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!	1
Monica, that was also true an	0
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!	4
You knew this about me when you married me!	0
You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.	0
Well, this is my sickness!	4
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.	0
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.	0
Yeah me too, all night.	0
Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?	2
Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.	0
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!	2
Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker	2
Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.	0
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!	4
So.	0
So.	0
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.	0
I mean, you know, we've never really talked.	0
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?	0
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.	5
Really? Me?	2
Oh my god, are you kidding?	2
Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.	4
Well, you're not totally paranoid.	0
Oy.	1
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.	3
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?	0
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.	1
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.	0
All right, Julie.	0
Bye.	0
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.	1
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.	0
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!	4
What?	2
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!	3
They put you in jail?	2
The little jail between the doors!	4
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!	4
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.	4
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.	3
Maybe it was the guy.	0
It was the ring!	4
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?	0
Well, if you want, I'll just... I'll just break it off with her.	0
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.	4
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.	0
Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.	0
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..	2
We can, we can go to Aruba!	1
When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.	3
You would've liked it.	3
I had a bra.	0
Hey, Dr. Farber.	0
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.	0
What?!	2
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.	5
Oh my God! What does	2
Oh that's an eye removal machine.	0
All right, I'm outta here!	4
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!	1
So were done then!	4
Almost! But first, we gotta start.	0
This is a glaucoma test.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Sit down.	0
Okay.	0
But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.	0
What?!	2
A small puff of air, now come on!	4
Sure, now I'm scared.	5
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.	0
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!	5
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!	1
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.	0
Oh, hey.	0
Hi.	0
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.	0
Hey!	2
Hey!	2
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.	0
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.	0
You're building a post office?	2
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.	0
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.	2
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.	0
Power saw kinda got away from me there.	0
Hi!	1
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!	4
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?	0
I can't seem to say goodbye.	3
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?	2
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!	4
It was cheesecake.	0
It was fine.	0
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling...  Wow!	2
My whole mouth just filled with saliva!	1
Y'know what? Forget it!	4
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.	0
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?	0
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.	0
This one's from me.	0
Ahh!	2
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.	0
A scooter!	2
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.	0
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.	1
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!	1
Okay.	0
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?	0
For my last birthday you gave me a	0
Okay.	0
Happy birthday Grandma!	1
It's better to be over the hill  then buried under it.	0
All our love Monica and Chandler.	0
That's funny, yeah!	1
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!	2
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!	1
No, because you're not a grandmother!	3
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things.	3
That's why it's so funny.	0
All you had to do was buy the card!	4
Hey, Joey. What's going on?	0
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.	0
Sorry. Wrong boobies.	3
Hello, Joey.	0
Oh! ...Hello, dear.	2
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?	2
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...	1
Really?	2
Hey, buddy.	0
Oh, that's attractive.	0
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.	1
Oh, ah- the kid has it.	0
The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.	4
You gotta do it, man.	0
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever... ... can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.	4

...Now	4
Oh, look, wish me luck!	1
What for?	0
I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.	0
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?	0
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!	4
What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!	2
Hi!	1
I'm so glad you could make it.	1
Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.	1
Try. There's my little girl.	1
She's still mad.	0
Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.	1
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?	2
Oh, that's very... Really very-very okay.	0
Julie's cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that's about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.	1
Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?	0
Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare.	0
Am I interrupting?	0
Uh yes! Thank you.	1
Oh. Oh wait no.	0
Later.	0
Oh uh, I'm sorry.	0
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!	5
Try feeding her again.	0
I already fed her.	0
I know, that's why I said again!	4
Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay?  That's just what she wants.	5
Hey.	0
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.	1
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.	3
For what?	1
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.	3
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.	0
You al-you already had it?	2
Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.	0
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.	3
We ruined everything.	3
Ugh	3
Well no, wait a minute, that's not true!	3
No, what did, that was really sweet.	1
And it kinda works out for the best.	1
What do you, what do you mean?	2
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!	1
I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don't even like!	1
Surprise	3
Surprise	1
Monica.	0
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!	4
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.	0
Not you guys.	0
You got it going on!	1
So, what are we gonna do today?	0
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.	0
Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!	2
I don't think so!	1
Why not?	0
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!	0
I'm not always that bad!	0
Oh,	0
I punched you...?	2
And...?	2
... Phoebe...?	2
... and...?	0
I clunked your heads together!	0
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.	3
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.	0
Yeah.	0
Hey!	2
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.	3
What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!	2
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.	0
All right. Did everyone get out okay?	5
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.	0
Ohh. What is this?	2
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!	5
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!	3
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?	0
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.	0
Hot dog?	0
Four, please.  I'm really nervous.  Thank you.	5
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?	0
I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.	1
Ohh, that's too bad!	3
No, I-I'm saying I liked her.	1
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.	0
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.	1
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?	0
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.	0
Hey, the fight's starting!	1
Okay, we'll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?	0
Nine times!	4
Okay, I had to put on lotion!	0
But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.	0
Fight's over!	0
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?	0
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.	2
Hi guys!	1
Hey!	0
What are you up too?	0
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites.	0
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.	0
Yeah, Big Brother.	0
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.	0
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?	0
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!	4
Eh	0
Okay well that's good to know.	3
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!	1
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.	1
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.	0
My friend's name is Joey.	0
Apparently Howie's editing now.	0
Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.	4
Can you believe that?!	2
Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!	2
Refill?	0
Hey! How you doing?	1
Good! Good, long time no see.	1
Like your sweater.	0
Oh hey, right back at ya.	0

Yeah. She... Well, she's one crazy lady?	2
So whose is it?	0
Umm, I don't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.	0
Okay.	0
He is so weird.	4
You wanna fool around with Joey?	2
Yeah!	1
You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!	1
And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!	2
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?	2
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.	0
Who, who are they?	0
I know them from work.	0
Both of them?	2
No, one of them...	0
Which one?	0
I don't know, what were the names I just said?	0
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.	4
All right, all right, you're right	3
What the hell are you cooking!	2
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!	2
Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officer... fireman, can-can I help you?	2
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.	4
That's not mine.	0
Yes it is.	0
How do you know?	5
Okay do you... Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!	4
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.	0
Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off!	4
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.	0
There's a reset button?!	2
My God!	2
Why didn't I see that!	2
Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?	0
Oh here it is!	1

Ohh, God!	1
"Four letters: ""Circle or hoop""."	0
Ring dammit, ring!	4
Thanks.	0
Hey, you know our phone's not working?	2
What?!	2
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.	0
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!	4
Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.	0
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?	4
Nngghhh!!!!!!!	4

Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.	0
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....	0
"""Benefits lapsed."""	0
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.	0
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.	0
Let me see that!	2
All right.	0
Oh, I can't believe this!	2
This sucks!	4
When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know?	5
And it wouldn't matter.	4
Now I gotta be careful?	4
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to  stop catching on fire.	3
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.	3
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.	0
look both ways before you cross the street.	1
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!	2
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.	1
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.	0
Do you know anything about women?	0
No.	0
That's all right.	0
Okay.	0
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.	1
Yeah. He could row like a viking.	1
Hi.	0
Mmm.	0
So how'd it go?	0
Oh, y'know..	0
Did he mention us?	0
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.	3
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.	3
...love you.	1
Are you're hands still wet?	0
Uh, moist, yeah.	0
Let's dry 'em again.	0
Oh my God! Oh my God!!	3
Still crying?	2
Like a	0
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.	0
What's the other one?	0
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one.	0
I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.	0
Oh that's right.	1
You're the talker.	0
Anyway uh, great idea!	1
Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.	0
Oh, we have some	0
No you don't!	4
Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.	0
Yeah, what town are we near?	0
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?	0
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?	4
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.	0
Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?	0
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.	3
Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?	0
Okay!	0
Yeah, no they don't do that.	0
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.	0
Who?	4
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?	5
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.	0
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!	4
But if...	5
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.	4
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.	1
So the going for help went well?	0
I'm telling you man, I saw it.	0
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.	4
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?	3
I know.	0
Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment.	0
Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come.	1
Chandler!	2
What is the matter with your face?!	2
"I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,"" not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!"""	4
Hey!	4
Don't laugh at him!	4
He's	0
We're gonna find love!	1
Definitely!	1
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.	0
That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!	1
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.	0
What do you mean?	0
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.	0
You mean a backup?	0
Exactly!	1
Yeah, yeah I got that.	0
You do?	0
Hm-mmm	0
Who?	0
Yeah!	1
Are you serious?!	2
Yeah, I locked him years ago!	1
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.	2
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.	0
Oh, seriously?	2
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?	0
Yeah, I'm sorry man.  You wanna go watch?	0
Yeah!	1
Good morning.	0
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?	1
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.	1
Ohh that's nice.	1
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!	1
Well kinda old, like 30.	0
Oh.	0
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.	2
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?	2
A little.	0
Yeah?	2
How you doin'?	0
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!	1
I know.	0
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?	1
What did you just say?	2
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.	1
Are you serious?!	2
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.	1
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.	1
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!	1
What do you say?	0
Okay!	1
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!	1
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?	4
It went under the table.	0
Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!	4
Here it is! Here it is!	1
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.	0
It's a four.	0
I think so too.	0
Well that's it. I'm done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.	1
Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.	1
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.	0
Is there anything we can do for you?	0
No just, nobody press on my stomach.	0
You can keep those pants by the way.	0
Whoa... hey... wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?	2
Yeah, you want some?	0
Ah, just cut me a little sliver.	1
A little bigger.	0
Little bigger.	0
What?!	2
Are you afraid you're gonna run out?!	4
Cut me a real piece!	4
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?	2
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.	0
Oh my God!	2
Of course, of course.	0
Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?	0
Umm, do you know each other's hometowns?	0
Why don't you...   Wh-what's going on?	5
Well, umm, not much.	0
But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know?	0
So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?	0
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?	0
Nothing..Why?	0
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!	4
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.	0
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?	4
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?	0
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this.	3
Okay,  I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you.	5
Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.	3
Your good heart Rach,  and, and....	3
No.	0
I can't, you're a totally different person to me now.	3
I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.	3
God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't,  it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.	3
It's just changed, everything.	3
Forever.	3
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.	3
Then how come it is?	3
Windows are clean, candels are lit.	0
Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.	1
Did I turn the fish?	0
No, cause I made lasagne.	0
Am I out of control?	4
Just a touch.	0
Mon, I don't understand.	0
I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?	2
I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.	2
What?	0
Could tonight be the Night?	1
I don't know.	0
Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.	1
Things happen, and they happen.	1
You don't plan these things.	0
So, did you shave your legs?	0
Yeah.	0
Ross!	4
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.	0
Hi!	1
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.	0
Uh-oh.	5
Is there a problem?	0
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.	0
But that's okay, no problem.	0
No problem.	0
Hmm, noodle soup.	0
"Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, ""Hmm, soup."""	0
Oh, what did I say?	2
Hmm, noodle soup.	0
How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!	2
All right, let's try one.	0
Hmm, noodle soup.	0
Okay. Let's do it again.	0
Okay.	0
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!	4
COME ON!!!!	4
Y'know what? We need to move on.	4
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!	4
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!	0
Yeah?	0
Give her some money.	0
I really think they're out of rooms.	0
They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!	4
Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are.	0
Okay.	0
Uh, say would you umm... Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?	0
This is a hospital.	0
Y'know what?	0
I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone.	4
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to... Whoa!	4
Oh gosh!	2
What-what?	2
Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!	2
Would you like to see a semi-private room?	0
Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.	0
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.	0
That's funny. Who are they?	1
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.	0
You mean they're lovers.	2
If you wanna put a label on it.	0
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?	2
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.	3
Okay, quick and painful.	0
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.	5
Oh, what? What-what?	2
Y'know Marcel?	0
...Yeah?	0
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.	3
Hi Pheebs!	1
Hi!	1
How are ya?	0
Good.	0
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?	0
Yeah.	0
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?	0
Yeah!	1
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!	4
Ooh, now you lost me.	5
You stole the phone!	4
No I didn't!	4
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?	4
No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!	5
Phoebe!	4
It's not here.	0
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?	0
How could I have left them in the copy room?	0
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.	4
Fine.	4
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!	1
This will be your phone.	0
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.	0
No you answer it and take pledges.	0
But I'm the host!	2
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.	0
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.	0
Well, here's your phone doctor.	0
Hey guys.	0
Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?	2
Well, he's very charming.	0
Well, you're just gonna have to try.	0
Joey, where are the	0
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...	0
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.	4
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!	1
Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?	2
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?	1
I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.	1
Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.	3
Come on more!	4
Oh God!	1
Yeah, you like that don't you?	0
Oh yeah right there!	1
You want it there? You take it there baby!	1
Uh Phoebe?	3
Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again.	1
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?	4
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be!	4
Huh?	0
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!	4
I talk to you and it's nothin'.	0
You look at me, and nothin'.	0
Nothing.	0
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.	1
Well, that was ah...	0
What?! What are you doing?!	2
Do you know what just happened?	4
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.	0
No. We were in the middle of sex...and	0
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!	1
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.	0
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.	0
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?	2
Oh, it's not!	0
Seriously, it's moving!	2
What the hell is in there?	2
It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.	0
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.	0
I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.	0
And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.	3
Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.	4
And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.	3
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	3
Thank you.	0
Rach?	2
I'll be out in a second.	0
Oh.  It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a	1
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.	0
in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon.  Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.	0
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.	0
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more.	1
I can't believe you don't want to know.	2
I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....	1
And Monica knows...	0
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!	2
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.	0
So what's it gonna be?	1
Wait... oh... hey... huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!	4
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!	1
Or an uncle...	0
Hey Phoebe!	1
Hi Pheebs!	1
Pheebs!	1
Fine!	4
Phoebe, what's the matter?	0
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.	3
Oh, right, that's me!	2
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.	0
Fine.	0
Phoebe, what is it?	0
All right, you know Paolo?	0
I'm familiar with his work, yes...	0
Well, he made a move on me.	4
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!	2
More coffee over here, please!	1
Hey.	0
Hey. What, what are you doing here?	2
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.	3
Yeah,  oh, but oh...	0
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....	0
Destiny.	0
Sure.	0
Yes.	0
All right.	0
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.	2
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.	0
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.	4
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.	0
So, what happens to the old guys?	3
Well, they go into the chipper.	0
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!	5
Hey! Hey!!	2
Light still out?	0
Yeah.	0
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.	0
Oh please, they're having sex.	3
Shut up!	4
So, whaddya think George is like?	0
I think he's shy.	0
Yeah?	2
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.	0
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean,	1
Aren't you with that girl over there?	0
Well, yeah, kinda.	0
Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I'm allowed to sleep with you.	0
No, no, no, it's flattery.	1
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.	1
Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast.	5
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...	0
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?	0
Um, yeah.	0
May I see it?	0
Um, no.	5
Come on!	1
But, okay.	0
I'm not on the list!	2
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.	0
It's laminated!	4
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.	0
Y'know it's ironic...	0
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.	0
We're just gonna be friends.	0
Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!	4
Hey Pheebs!	1
Ohh! You made up!	2
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.	0
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.	1
We have one.	0
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!	2
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?	0
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!	0
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!	2
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?	0
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!	4
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!	4
So that's the only reason she could be here huh?	0
It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a	0
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!	4
I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later.	0
Good-bye.	0
Whoa!	2
Uh, that was your sister actually.	0
She-she thinks that you're just using me.	0
So?	0
I'm sorry.	3
What are you doing here?!	2
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.	0
What?!	2
Umm, okay, okay, look.	0
I took this picture from your fridge.	4
Okay, because I know that this is my Father.	4
Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.	4
Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.	4
All right?	4
So if you can help me find my Father then you should!	4
Otherwise, you're just mean!	4
So, just tell me the truth!	4
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.	0
My Father is Chuck Magioni?	2
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!	0
And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.	3
Oh.	3
But umm, you're right.	0
I think that a person should know where they come from.	0
Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.	0
I'm your mother.	0
Heh?	2
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...	3
What's happening to your accent?	2
Come again?	2
What's-what's this nonsense?	5
All right, I'm-I'm not English.	3
I'm from Long Island.	0
I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.	3
I'm sorry.	3
So, if we could just get back to the lecture.	0
Umm, were there any questions?	0
About paleontology.	0
All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.	4
Obviously, I screwed up.	3
But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.	0
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression	0
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am	4
Well, hello Rachel!	2
Where you going, Joe?	0
For a walk.	0
Oh. You mind if I join you?	0
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.	0
Your thoughts? Plural?	2
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!	1
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.	0
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??	4
You guys are killing me!	3
She's forbidden fruit!	3
It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?	3
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?	0
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.	0
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.	4
Great novels?	2
Fine ... mediocre porn	0
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.	0
Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.	0
That's kinda sad.	3
Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,	0
Got it!	1
Let's roll!	1
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?	0
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything... minute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.	0
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.	0
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?	0
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?	0
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.	0
Oh! No problem! I	1
What?	2
You are iron.	0
You are steel!	1
Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?	4
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?	0
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!	2
Look, you and I went to different high schools...	0
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.	0
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.	0
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.	3
They had to have that specially made?!	2
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.	0
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!	2
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out.	2
And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.	1
I-I owe her this.	0
I never let her eat.	0

Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.	3
Why would we do that?	2

We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.	0
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?	3

We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.	1
Hey! How's it goin'?	0
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.	0
Yes it has! I made cookies!	1

Okay.	0
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!	1
Okay, I'll be out in a second.	0

Me too, we should get goin'.	0
No.	0
Okay, here comes another camera.	0
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.	0

They've been taping those people up there all day.	0
Right.	0
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?	1
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?	1

Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.	1
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.	2
Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn't tell him that, though? Right?	5
Ummmmmmmm, no.	0
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!	4
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date... oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.	3
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.	0
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.	0
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.	2

Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.	0
So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.	1
Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?	0
Oh my god.	2
What?	2
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.	4

Oh!	2
Ow!	2
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.	0
Really?	2

Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps... She knows!	4
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.	5
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.	0

But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!	2
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!	5
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.	5

That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it'  Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.	0

Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.	4
This doesn't mean anything, does it?	5
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?	4
That is true.	0
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.	0
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.	0
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.	0
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!	3
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.	4
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.	0
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!	4
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!	0
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!	4
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.	5
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.	0
I think that's gum.	0
I'm pretty sure it's gun.	0
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.	4
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?	4
That was the only way I could get him to	0
Hi! How are the Gellers?	0
Don't call us that!	4
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?	4
Hey! It's Porsche!!	4
Hey sweetie!	1
Hey!	1
There's no back to this couch!	2
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.	2
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know?	0
Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.	0
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.	1
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.	0
Stop it!	1
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.	0
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.	0
Yeah?	0
Of course he is!	1
What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse?	1
What kind of father do you think I am?	4
All right, sorry.	0
I gotta go make a fake Ben.	0
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!	2
Well, either that or uh	0
Joey!!	4
Yeah?	0
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!	4
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!	4
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!	1
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!	1
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.	0
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!	1
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a	4
Sure!	0
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it.	0
I mean, everyone should have a-a	0
Oh my God Ross!!	2
You like it?	1
I	0
Yeah?	0
Hello darlings.	0
And there's daddy!	1
There he is! There he is!	2
Where?	0
Right- where we've been looking all night!	1
He is so cute!	1
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!	1
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the... ... wowww.	1
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.	1
Yeah, isn't he?	1
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.	1
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.	1
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.	2
Huh. That's nice.	0
and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for	0
Eight whole days.	0
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.	1
Awesome!	1
Yeah?	2
My favorite part was when	0
The Armadillo was actually not so	0
Hey!	1
Oh.	0
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.	2
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!	1
Oh.	0
Oh.	0
Okay, I understand why	0
Yeah, sure. Good luck!	1
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo!  I'm okay!! I'm all right!!	1
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.	2
What?	0
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?	2
Why would you say that?	0
Cause you're still into Monica.	0
So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...	0
You're good. You're good!	1
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.	0
Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?	5
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?	0
Thanks a lot.	0
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.	0
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.	0
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!	4
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.	0
Oh, thanks, sweetie.	1
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.	1
Really?	2
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?	5
No, no, they will. I just... uh...	0
Can't wait.	0
Do I know you?	2
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?	2
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.	0
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.	2
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.	1
Uh, wait, backstage?	2
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.	0
Ross.	0
Chandler.	0
Look, you guys wanna meet the group?	0
Come on.	0
So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?	2
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.	4
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.	0
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.	0
Really?	2
He does?	2
Hey, buddy, what's up!	1
Oh, she told you about that, huh.	2
Well, yeah, I have one now and then.	0
Well, yeah, now.	0
Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.	0
Well, okay, thanks!	1
God, he's good.	1
If only he were a woman.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, look look look.	2
The last candle's about to burn out.	0
10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....	0
Thank you.	0
Thanks.	0
Kinda... spooky without any lights.	5
Bwah-hah-hah!	1
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...	1
Oh.. oh... oh.	0
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.	0
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?	0
You blew them away!	1
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!	1
I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?	0
I was	2
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!	1
Oh my God!  I'm your	2
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!	1
Look, I took it too far!	1
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.	0
Could've played	0
Thanks.	0
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.	0
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the	0
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?	0
Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.	0
Nooo!	2
Hello?	0
Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.	0
Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.	1
Green. To the green.	0
I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.	0
To the left, to the left- aww!	0
Ohhh... I'm fine.	0
Hey!	1
Please tell me you got the message!	5
What message?	0
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.	0
What?! It's 6 o'clock!	2
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!	5
I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!	4
I went to Ross's!	0
I went to the coffeehouse!	0
I went to any place that they made sandwiches!	0
That's the day you're gonna die? See... darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.	0
That's what you think.	0
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?	0
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.	0
What was her name?	0
Nestley Toulouse.	0
Nestle Toll House?	0
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.	0
Yes!!  Oh.	2
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!	4
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  you're burning in hell!!	4
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?	0
Absolutely!	1
I am so on board!	1
Rachel didn't you just light that?	0
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.	0
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.	0
Tell me about it!	0
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!	1
It does sound appealing.	0
Oh, I never could do it.	1
Oh but you could.	0
You can.	0
Absolutely!	1
We can help each other out!	1
We can get--what are those--those patches!	0
We could be like the Patch Sisters!	1
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!	1
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!	1
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.	3
Okay then!	1
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?	0
Does, um, anyone wanna see?	0
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!	4
Hey, this is so unfair!	4
Oh, why is it unfair?	2
So I have a flaw!	4
Big deal!	4
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?	4
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?	4
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?	4
...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?	4
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?	4
Well, I-I could live without it.	0
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?	0
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.	0
"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?"	4
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.	0
"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."	1
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.	0
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.	4
Awww! Mel Torme died.	3
Joey, that paper's like a year old!	0
Aw! Does that mean the	3
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?	0
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.	0
Probably?	0
Kind of what 'probably' really means.	0
Yeah, uh-huh.	0
"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y'know?"	4
"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"""	4
You gotta take care of yourselves!	0
In	0
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?	0
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.	1
Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?	1
He's a keeper. How are you feeling?	0
Oh, I'm fine.	0
Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone.	0
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.	0
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?	0
Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!	0
I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.	0
Well I... That's never gonna happen with Ross.	3
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.	0
Hey. Who's that?	0
New people.	0
What happened to the Disgustingtons?	0
They're having their baby!	4
It's not fair Ross we got here first!	4
Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.	0
Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.	0
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?	2
Phoebe?	0
Yeah?	0
Look at that guy by the window, wow!	2
He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.	0
Oh, what is wrong with me lately?	3
I mean it's like every guy I see... I mean look here.	0
Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.	0
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?	0
Yeah.	0
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.	0
Really?! So this has happened to you?	2
Oh absolutely yeah!	0
Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.	0
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.	1
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a	0
I don't know what I'm going to do!	5
I called the company that sent and th-they don't care!	4
Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?	4
Hey guys!	1
Hey!	1
Hey	0
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!	1
And the guys from work had a blast.	1
Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.	1
Yeah!	1
And-and another one had never been to a party before, so	2
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!	1
Yeah, right!	1
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those	0
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.	2
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?	2
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.	1
So you might say, it's a magic ring.	1
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!	2
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.	0
Obviously! So, how do we decide?	0
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her	0
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.	0
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her	1
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction	0
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.	0
Yeah well we should order some food then.	0
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll	0
That sounds fair.	0
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street	0
Ah yeah... wait a second now!	4
Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.	0
I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.	4
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.	0
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.	0
So let's decide on the spending limit	0
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?	0
I was thinking more like a hundred.	0
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?	0
Hi, again.	0
Hey!	0
Hey!	0
Thank you soo, much.	1
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.	4
You want some help with that?	0
Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don't!	0
Whoa! Are you okay?	2
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.	2
It's the heat.  And-and the humidity.	0
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.	0
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?	0
Like you wouldn't believe.  Wow! This is a great place.	2
What do you mean?	0
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.	0
Oh!	2
Hey, somebody left their keys.	0
Ooohh, to a Porsche!	2
Hey Gunther, these yours?	0
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?	0
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?	0
There's a lost and found?  My shoe!	2
You left a shoe here?!	2
Well, I didn't realize until I got home.	0
I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!	0
I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.	0
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.	0
Great! Thanks.	1
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.	0
Carol, we've been through this before, ok?	1
We have a good time.	1
We laugh, we play.	1
It's like we're father and son.	1
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.	1
Oh, this is so cute.	1
Oh, I got that for him.	0
My mommies love me. That's clever.	1
Hello?	0
Oh, Hi, Ju... ... Hi, Jew!	0
Uh huh?	0
Uh huh?	0
Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.	0
See ya then.	0
Bye.	0
Did you just say Hi, Jew?	2
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.	0
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!	1
Thanks Monica!	1
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.	2
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.	0
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.	1
Okay!	1
Okay.	0
Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It's for you. It's the fire inspector.	0
Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!	2
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire.	0
No-no, it was the candles.	0
It's very not good leaving candles unattended.	0
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is...  Uhh... Uhh... Okay.	0
Well, I have to go now.	0
Joey proposed to me.	2
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!	2
Well, I-I said yes.	5
What?!	2
Are you crazy?	4
You just had Ross's baby!	4
It's-it's so  inappropriate.	4
It's... It is bigger than  mine!	2
I know.	0
You can't marry him!	3
Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.	3
Well do you love him?	0
Sure.	0
Sure?	0
Yeah, I mean whatever.	0
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?	3
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?	0
Here comes the bride.	1
Oh my God Monica!	2
I wanna wear this everyday.	1
You look so beautiful.	1
I'm so happy for me.	1
Hello?	0
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?	5
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.	0
Damnit!	4
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?	4
Fine.	0
Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.	4
And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!	4
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I	0
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff!	3
And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!	0
Crap!!	4
I gotta go!	0
Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?	2
No.	0
Me neither! We have to get in!	2
Just act like you belong.	0
Oh my God! Oranges!	2
Shh!  Nice to see you again.	0
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?	0
Yes, of course.	0
I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.	0
Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.	0
Okay!	1
Y'know what?	0
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.	1
All I really needed was a plan.	0
See I wanna have three kids	0
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.	1
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years.	0
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!	1
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,	4
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!	4
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?	4
I don't know.	0
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!	4
I don't think you have much choice.	0
Well we'll see!	4
Bye-bye!	0
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?	0
Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .	0
Dad?	0
I'm here!	0
Hey!	2
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.	1
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.	3
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.	0
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.	0
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.	3
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories	1
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven	0
I used to	0
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.	0
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a	0
Ok, got the vent open.	0
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!	1
Ben, you ready?	0
All right, gimme your foot.	0
Ok, on three, Ben.	0
One, two, three.	0
Ok, That's it, Ben.	0
What do you see?	0
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.	0
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!	2
Wait! You forgot your legs!	2
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.	1
Thank you.	1
Filing system?	0
Oh-oh!	2
You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?	0
It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.	1
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.	0
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.	0
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.	1
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost	1
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.	0
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!	1
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.	0
Yes, I realize that	0
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.	0
I love working with designers!	1
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?	0
Chandler, you have an assistant right?	0
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!	5
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.	0
I do?	2
Yeah!  All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.	0
Okay.	0
Or not.	0
Where's Chandler?	0
Here I am.	0
How did you...know?	2
Hey! What's she doing back here?	2
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!	0
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...	0
What happened in Atlantic City?!	2
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar	0
"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""	4
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?	0
So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.	0
Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.	1
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.	2
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.	4
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard	1
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?	4
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.	0
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?	0
Of course I am!	1
Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.	0
I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.	0
And-and then guess what?	0
The baby's coming and I don't know what to do.	3
Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?	3
No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.	0
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?	5
I'm going to the bathroom.	0
Okay.	0
Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.	0
It	0
Hey!	1
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?	2
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.	0
Not if you were here.	0
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.	0
Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it's you!	1
I hope it's you.	0
Me too!	1
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me	1
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!	1
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.	0
Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine	0
Yes!!! Oh!!	1
Hypothetically!	4
Still.	0
If Phoebe were my maid of honor	0
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.	0
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.	0
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?	0
Well that's the best part. Umm,	0
Wh-why is that the best part?	2
Because then I don't have to!	1
Well of	0
I'm really not deciding!	1
Fine!	4
Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!	1
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?	0
It's not just the drum noise.	0
"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!"	4
"Oh god, my eye!"""	4
I mean, it is so annoying.	4
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.	0
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?	2
Maybe on some level.	0
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?	2
No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.	0
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.	1
And, a brownie!	1
Well, half a brownie.	0
Actually, it's just bag.	0
It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so	0
Oh man!	1
This is so great!	1
I actually feel like I'm going on a real date!	1
Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there.	0
Hey come on now, this is a real date.	0
Uh, so...nice place you got here.	0
Foosball, huh?	2
Pizza box.	0
Oh, a subscription to	2
Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.	0
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.	0
Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.	0
Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?	1
Hm-mmm	0
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?	0
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.	0
No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!	4
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?	4
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.	0
Ha. Ha, ha.	1
What?	0
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.	0
Oh, I beg to differ. The	0
That was	0
Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!	1

He forgot to leave his grip size!	2
He didn't get the goggles!	2
Well,sounds like you two have issues.	0
Goodbye, baby.	0
Ciao, bela.	0
Do they wait for me to do this?	0
So are you gonna tell him?	0
Why would I tell him?	0
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.	0
What are you guys doing here?	4
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!	2
...What did I ask?	0
Ross, ten o'clock.	0
Is it? Feels like two.	3
No,	0
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!	1
Oh. Hel-lo!	1
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!	1
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.	1
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'	5
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!	1
Oh please, could she	0
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.	0
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.	0
You could do that!	1
You think?	2
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.	0
OK.	0
This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?	1
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.	0
Last time I do that, I promise.	0

Okay.	0
Okay.	0
So, are we going in there?	0
I am!!	1
Wow!	2
It actually is in the handbook.	0
I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.	0
I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.	3
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.	1
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.	0
Wow!	2
What?	2
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.	1
Really?	2
Yeah.	0
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.	1
Stop it!	1
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.	1
Shut the book!	1
Let's also get a hot plate!	1
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends	1
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?	1
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.	0
I do the same thing.	0
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25	1
I'm just kidding too.  I'm getting married in December.	1
So when are you getting married?	0
Oh May 15	0
Oooh it's getting close!	1
So uh, who's your photographer?	0
Jeffrey	0
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?	0
The best man? Wow!	2
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!	1
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.	0
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.	3
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!	1
Oh y'know what?	0
Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off.	0
So, does this  come in another color or	0
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.	0
It was unbelievable!	2
We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...	1
So have you called her yet?	0
Let her know I like her?	5
What are you, insane?	4
It's the next day!	1
How needy do I want to seem?	0
I'm right, right?	0
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.	0
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.	2
Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!	4
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.	0
Her answer machine?	0
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.	0
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?	0
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!	2
Okay, okay, what's going on?	0
Okay, they're just talking...	0
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?	0
So, um, what do you do for a living?	0
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.	0
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.	0
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.	3
Now that is funny.	0
Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?	0
Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.	3
I guess.	0
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?	0
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.	0
Come on.	0
These people'll scooch down.	0
You guys'll scooch, won't you?	0
Let's try scooching!	1
Come on.	0
Come on.	0
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.	0
Carol, Kristin.	0
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.	0
And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!	1
Okay.	0
When I was six years old.	0
Hm-mm	0
I wanted a big wheel.	0
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.	4
It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.	3
That was a pretty tough year.	3
That's-that's great!	1
See?	0
I already feel like I know you a little better!	1
Thank you.	1
Okay, come on.	0
Now we can go eat.	0
Let's go.	0
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.	3
Oh!	2
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?	4
That's patio furniture!	2
"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!"	0
What about the birds?	0
"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something."""	0
You pick one.	0
All right, how about the ladybugs?	0
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!	4
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!	4
Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!	3
Bijan for men?	0
Bijan for men?	0
Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.	0
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.	0
Ready, Annabelle?	0
You bet.  Maybe some other time?	0
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!	3
That was amazing!	1
Phoebe and Gary are	0
That was amazing.	1
We are the hottest! Huh?	1

I	0
Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'?	0
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?	0
So what are you gonna do?	0
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.	3
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.	3
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?	3
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!	4
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.	0
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.	0
Why? What happened to him?	0
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.	0
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.	0
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.	1
Well, okay, so what's now... go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.	0
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.	0
"Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?"""	2
Um-hmm, five actually.	0
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?	0
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.	0
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!	2
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?	0
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.	0
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.	0
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.	0
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.	0
So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.	0
No, I'm sorry.	0
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!	2
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.	4
Hey!	0
Hey!	0
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!	2
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!	4
I don't know, clean places?	0
Mm, yum!	0
It's Danny.	0
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.	5
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?	4
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!	2
The fake kind!	4
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?	0
We have a ladle.	0
Thanks, see you at the party.	0
Okay, great!	1
"Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, ""See you ladle."""	0
You're so efficient. I love you!	1
Let's go!	1
No-no-no! We need something old!	3
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.	0
That'll work!	1
I don't think so.	0
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!	1
Here just...take this.	0
That's stealing!	3
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.	0
Ohh.	1
Okay, one thing at a time.	0
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?	0
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.	1
Oh, that's great.	1
Why are- why are you so tanned?	2
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.	0
Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.	1
Oh God, oh.	4
Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...	3
Monica? Monica!	4
Water rules!	1
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?	0
Nope. Going to the	0
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!	4
No, it is me!	1
Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!	4
Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.	1
I'm- I'm Monana!	1
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.	0
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.	1
What?	0
They've arrested Monica.	3
Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.	0
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?	0
No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!	0
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.	0
I just...	0
I wrote that out phonetically for you.	0
Phonetically?	0
Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.	0
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!	2
"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days""    I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."	1
Wow. What does	2
No idea!	2
"But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."	0
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?	0
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .	0
Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't	4
Come on! you...	0
No!	4
Oh.  Oh-oh.	0
Hey!  What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?	2
Done!	1
You just finished?	2
Well, I wanted to be thorough.	0
I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!	1
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!	1
So umm, does it?	0
I'm sorry.	3
Does it?	5
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.	0
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!	4
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even	4
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't	0
Are you sure?	1
Oh, sure! I'm sure.	1
You got married again.	0
Yes.	0
So that's your second marriage in two years.	0
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.	0
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.	0
Why don't you tell me what happened.	0
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk	0
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?	2
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do	0
Oh, that's better then.	0
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.	0
I see. Have you considered therapy?	0
I think just the	0
There are a couple of forms to fill out.	0
Easy.	0
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.	0
No problem.	0
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.	0
Ooh!	2
There's no way to do this without her?	2
Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.	5
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.	0
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.	0
Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.	0
What?	2
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.	0
That's alright, I'll take it.	0
Bad things happen to me anyway.	0
This way I can break 'em up with a movie.	0
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...	0
You wanna do it right now?	0
Great!	1
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from	0
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from	0
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.	0
You're welcome.	0
is for me not to see you anymore.	3
That's crazy!	2
You can't do that!	2
What are you going to tell her?	3
Oh God.	5
Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?	3
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.	3
And I do, I have to make	3
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That	2
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.	3
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.	4
What are you doing?	2
Storming out!	4
Rachel, this is your apartment.	0
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!	4
These little women. Wow!	2
Your liking it, huh?	0
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.	1
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.	0
Chandler.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
Joey.	0
Hey-hey!	1
Hey.	0
This is Monica.	0
Whoa!	2
And this is Rachel.	0
Hi!	1
Whoa!!	2
I'm gonna get coffee.	0
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?	1
We don't, really.	0
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?	0
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.	1
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.	0
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.	0
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.	0
Okay, Chandler!	0
Okay.	0
"And your horoscope says, ""On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."""	1
Oh, well thank you in advance.	1
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.	2
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.	2
Hey guys!	0
Hey!!	1
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!	2
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?	1
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!	1
No! Joey, you're going to be great!	0
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology!	5
I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn!	4
And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!	4
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.	4
I'll be waiting.	0
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?	1
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.	2
I know!	2
Now look, there's only one problem though.	1
There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.	0
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.	3
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.	0
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.	0
Okay!	1
So Rach!	1
You're the first guest at Hotel Monica!	1
Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.	0
And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed.	0
Oh, you have been through so much.	3

See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.	4

Fine!	4
If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself!	4
And don't you follow me!	4

Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?	4
Not right now.	0
It-it... The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.	3
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!	3
I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!	1
Y'know you... I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.	0
I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.	0
Oh yes! Thank you very much!  Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.	1
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!  Yes!	1
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!	1
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?	1
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?	0
Pick a number! That is your	0
8. 8!	1
Thank you!	1
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!	1
Yeah, I understand.	0
Take as much time as you want.	0
Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it.	0
I'll be here.	3
Not smoking.	3
We're really gonna do this, huh?	2
Looks like it.	0
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at	0

Okay.	0
Susan! Hi!	1
Hey!	1
Thank you so much for coming.	1
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.	1
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.	0
Hello Ross.  I love what you've done with this space.	1
Thank you so much.	1
How hot is this?!	2
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm	0
G.I. Joe	0
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!	1
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.	3
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers.	0
And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.	0
Down at the docks again?	4
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?	0
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.	4
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.	4
You're a big scrud.	4
What's a scrud?	0
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.	4
I don't have too. I can just look at you.	1
All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice.	1
Not nice enough.	4
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.	0
So, how'd the lasagne go over?	0
Really?!	2
Good.	0
So you owe me three pretty things.	0
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too.	0
It's hard this whole platonic thing.	3
It's a word!	2
Yeah, I do think it's better this way.  Yeah, we're being smart.   Yes, I'm sure.	0
You really sure?	0
I'll call you back.	0
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?	2
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.	0
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.	0
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.	0
I am	0
I think you're better than you think you are.	0
Really? Okay, so	2
Know when to stop.	0
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?	0
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance.	0
Right!	1
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!	4
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?	2
She broke my arm.	4
He touched my fanny.	4
No, she touched mine first!	4
That's my job!	4
Are you being British?!	2
No. Not anymore.	0
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?	2
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.	0
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?	4
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.	4
Where is this party?	0
Here in Chelsea.	0
Who's party is it?	4
A woman's	0
What woman?!	4

So like which of these two guys do you want to be?	3
Can I be that guy?	1
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!	1
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.	4
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!	5
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.	2
Oh no-no-no, that's not... No-no-no!	4
Did you just flick me?	4
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]	1
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!	4
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!	4
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.	4
Ow! Ow! Ow!	4
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.	0
Fine!	4
Fine!	4
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.	0
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.	0
Oh my God!	2
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I	1
Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on.	0
I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before.	3
I don't need to have a game room.	0
I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I	0
Stop it Chandler.  I'm sorry too.	3
Really?	2
Yeah! Oh yes!	4
Ohh.	0
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.	1
That's a great idea! We can	1
Totally!	1
We don't have to come up with this now.	0
Oh good.	1
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.	0
That's great. Good for you guys.	1
I am not high maintenance!	4
I am not a pushover!	4
Who said you were?	0
You did!	4
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.	0
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.	1
That does not sound stupid to me.	0
You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?	0
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.	3
Next on Ross... Uh-oh.	0
What uh-oh?	1
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.	5
It's, uh, it's a song.	0
The laundry song that we sing.	0
Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.	0
Ross, what's the matter?	4
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.	0
Why are you here?	2
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...	3
No no no... I mean,	0
Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in    a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .	4
What!?	2
This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!	1
I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date...	1
Please... go!  Just let me know if you    need a hand!	0
I think it just fell off.	0
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!	3
And I just want a million dollars!	5
Rachel?!	2
Yeah.	0
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!	4
And we're not a couple of suckers!	4
I hear ya, Mugsy!	0
But look, all these rooms are fine okay?	0
Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.	4
Okay,	0
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!	4
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?	4
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!	4
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?	4
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!	4
Do not speak ill of the dead.	4
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?	4
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.	3
What did you say?	4
"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn."""	5
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.	0
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y'know, technically we still	0
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?	0
Kay!	0
Can I ask you something?	0
Uhh, no.	0
Felicity and I, we're watching	0
No.	0
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?	0
Yes.	0
Thanks man.	0
Okay man.	0
But what about how much taller he is than me?	0
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know?	0
And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?	4
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.	2
I know!	4
Had the beef-tips, huh?	0
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.	0
Not so fast Wesley!	4
Ramoray!	3
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!	4
Oh! Thank God!	1
Hope! Hope!	1
Drake!	1
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.	1
Oh Drake.	1
Okay!	1
Here we go!	1
Okay!	1
Hi, Joey!	1
It's Rachel!	1
Umm, I am free tomorrow night.	0
Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.	0
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...	0
Men are here.	0
Mom, would you relax.	3
That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that.	3
Mom, c'mon, stop worrying.	5
This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing	0
Hi.	0
Hi, hi can I help you?	1
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?	0
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.	0
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.	0
What?	2
Hey, how, how did you do that?	2
Alright, somebody.	0
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.	0
Whoooaa!	2
That's my sister.	0
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.	0
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?	2
Pheebs, what about you?	0
Oh... Milwaukee.	0
Um... Ross?	0
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'	0
No way!	2
The ride broke down.	0
So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.	1
Oh, Rachel.	0
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Oh, is the play over?	0
Yeah. Where were you?	0
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.	0
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.	1
Nah. I kept myself busy.	0
Oh, okay, yeah.  I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.	0
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.	0
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff.	0
Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate... And I think that you should.	0
You should, you should ask Rachel to help.	0
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.	0
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.	1
Really?!	2
Hey, y'know what?	2
Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.	0
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.	1
No! I do want to!	1
Oh, she does want to.	0
She does want to.	0
Yeah!	1
Wow, you have really pretty feet.	2
These old things.	3
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.	4
You mean the... Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.	0
Yeah.	0
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real  nice and tight.	0
So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.	2
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.	0
Oh.	0
Ow! Did you just bite me?	2
No!	2
Um, that's it.	0
No.	0
Crew guy.	0
Yeah.	0
Why have you been following me?	4
I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.	0
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....	3
What?	2
One more chance Ursula, please?	3
Okay.	0
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.	0
Good deal.	1
Here you go.	0
Thank you.	0
Hi!	1
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!	1
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.	5
Oh, okay.	0
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.	5
But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it.	1
But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime.	5
So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.	5
Wow! Umm....	2
I dropped a cup.	0
Hello, tiny embryos.	0
Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi!	1
I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months.	1
You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there!	1
Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on.	1
Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh!	1
And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.	0
Ready?	0
Uh-huh.  Good luck.	3
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.	0
Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so	3
I'm not your brother.	0
What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!	4
Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.	0
Are you kidding me?!	4
It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!	4
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!	4
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.	0
"Uh, don't you mean ""for whom?"""	0
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?	0
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.	0
Is there something wrong?	0
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay?	0
You're hot.	0
I'm lovable.	0
Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.	0
But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.	0
Joey...	0
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm	5
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some!	1
Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment.	0
Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister.	0
Well, I'm off to bed!	0
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!	1
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.	1
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!	1
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk.	5
Okay?	0
Umm, look I like you.	5
I-I really do, I like you a lot.	5
Okay?	4
But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very	1
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!	2
Oh, Joey! Sorry!	2
They made you head of the department!	1
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didn't I get head of the department?	1
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm	0
Yeah.	0
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?	0
Uh, Paul's Cafe. They got great food and it's really romantic.	0
Ooh, great! Thanks!	1
Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the	0
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya	0
Ooh, I miss dating.	3
Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.	0
I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun!	1
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.	0
Hey, y'know what?	0
Huh?	0
Why don't I take you out?	0
What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.	2
Yes I do!	1
And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out	1
Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.	1
I'll be fun.	0
All right?	0
Hi!	1
Hey!	1
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking	0
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good	1
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!	1
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?	2
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.	0
Oh screw her, that part is mine!	4
Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.	0
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.	2
I can't believe you married him.	2
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a	4
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.	3
It's over! You	1
How can I?	2
Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?	3
How can I accept that...	3
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.	3
Kiss me.	1
What?	2
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?	1
The bigger half.	0
I'd like to propose a toast.	1
Little toast here, ding ding.	1
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.	1
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?	4
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.	1
That's so sweet.	1
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.	1
And a crappy New Year.	1
Here, here!	1
Now, hold on!	4
Hold on!	4
Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too!	4
Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay?	4
She's-she's just a friend and that's all!	4
That's all!	3
Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.	4
Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.	3
All right, I'll tell her.  Come on bugger face!	4
Call me.	0
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!	4
What happened?!!	2
Well, I don't know!!	2
We fell asleep! That is all.	0
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.	0
I think that would be best.	0
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.	0
Okay. But not about this!	4
No! Never! Never!  Bye.	4
No touch! No touch!	0
Umm ma'am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.	3
What?	2
It's a funny story, actually.	0
I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really  know what I was saying.	0
You fell asleep?	2
But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain't that funny?	5
Irony?	2
Not a fan, alright .	0
See, here's  the thing.	0
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go.	0
See, me, I  love Tulsa!	1
Tulsa is heaven!	1
Tulsa is Italy. Please don't make me go  there!	5
Chandler, I...	1
No no no!	5
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?	0
Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine?	1
Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping!	1
That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it,  well she's lovely.	1
I like a girl with a strong jaw.	3
I'll call you from Tulsa.	0
Hi.	0
Hey.	0
How are you?	0
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?	0
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.	0
That I was not expecting.	2
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.	0
Oh. Thanks.	0
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing	1
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.	0
I just can't believe you're in here.	2
I mean, what am I gonna do without you?	3
Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?	3
Who's gonna take me to the	3
What do you mean?	0
Smell familiar?	0
Oh no.	5
Oh, I am so sorry.	3
No me, I am so sorry...	3
Oh my.	2
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.	5
Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.	5
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.	0
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?	0
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.	0
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.	0
Tho?	0
Ohhh.	5
That's good, have a seat.	0
Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.	0
You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?	0
Can you do that for me?	0
Ok.	0
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?	0
Yes!	5
All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.	0
Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!	4
Let go of my hand!	4
You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!	1
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!	1
Well...let's just say	0
Oo, where are the seats?	1
Uh, middle balcony.	0
You're a mean old woman.	4
No! Wait no! Shut up... I mean don't cry! Let me get my checkbook!	3
Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay?	2
It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me.	1
You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity!	1
That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!	1
That means nothing to me.  Come on!	4
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.	5

I'm sorry. I didn't... I don't come in here a lot.	3
: Oh yeah, of course you don't!	4
: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?	4
Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?	4
Okay, I'm sorry.	3
Hello!	1

Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.	4
Thank you.	0
I don't know how any of these got opened?!	2
You opened them all?	2

Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!	1
Yeah. What is that?	0
Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami.	3
Hey! How'd it go?	3

So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?	0
No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.	0
Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.	1
I'm not?	2
Listen I uh...  It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom.	5
Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.	0
So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?	1
Thank you.	0
If I can't have it you can't have it!	4

Paris?	0
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .	0

Who is that?!	2
Don't worry, I'm brave!	3
I am brave!	5
I...I am brave!	5
No-no-no-no!!	5
Can you tell me who is there please?	0
Hi!	1
Hi. Do you know what time it is?	0

Mm! Night Gar'!	0
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!	1
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.	0
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?	0
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.	0
Well have we finished the scene?	2
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.	1
As were you.	0
So I got your car, it's right outside.	0
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.	1
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.	5
Is that my ass?	1

Definitely!	1
Not as each other!	0
Oh, then no.	0
Hey!	1
Hi!	4
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.	1
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.	1
Let me see the earrings.	0
Oh, honey, the earrings	0
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?	1
My boyfriend really does have good taste!	1
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.	0
Mm-Hm	0
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.	0
Oh my God! Look at this!	2
Okay, but there	0
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!	4
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.	0
And did you?!	3
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.	0
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.	0
Oh my God.	2
Hello darling.	0
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.	0
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna	0

Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand.	3
I-I am so sorry, I'll go.	3
Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.	3
Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.	0
I found my identical hand twin!	1
Ohh, you are	0
No!	0
But she just came up here!	2
That was Joey!	0
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.	0
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.	0
Would you stop that!	4
Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?	0
She didn't feel anything for him.	0
She loves you!	3
Really?	2
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.	4
Okay.	0
Good.  I should really start wearing hats!	0
I mean, why should I let them meet him?	0
I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.	1
Listen.	0
As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.	0
I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.	0
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.	3
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..	0
No-no-no-no.  Hey!	2
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.	0
Hey sweetie.	0
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?	0
I can't tell you. It's a secret.	0
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.	4
Awww.  But still no.	0
No I'm serious, we should tell each other	0
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at	0
Oh no-no, I can't do that.	5
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.	0
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
So, Ross and I are going to	0
No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe's secret?	0

Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!	2
Oh! You got it?!	3
Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.	1
What was it for?	0
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century.	0
It's really classy!	1
Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese.	1
The next next?	0
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right?	0
But then this guy's right after him.	0
Hello!	1
They loved me!	1
Oh my God!	1
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!  Oh.  Uh, okay uh let me call you back.	2
What's the matter?	0
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!	2
Wow!	2
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!	1
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.	1
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!	1
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.	2
Who?	0
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames.	0
Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.	0
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?	0
Umm, no. No.	0
Yes you did! What was it?	2
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.	0
Ohh that's so sweet!	1
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time!	1
Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not.	2
I mean it's not at all.	0
Dr. Geller!	1
Burt!	1
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.	0
Okay, shoot.	0
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.	0
I didn't get it?	0
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.	1
Okay, what else?	0
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'	0
Oh.	3
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'	0
Hey.	0
How's the maniac?	0
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.	1
Phoebe, what are you doing?	2
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.	0
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.	1
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?	2
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?	2
What are you saying I should do?	0
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.	0
Thank you, Monica.	1
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.	0
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.	2
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!	1
Ooh, let's see it!	1
She's not crazy is she?	2
No.	0
So uh, how you doin'?	0
There he is!	1

Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.	1

Comin' through. Move, move.	4
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.	1

So?	0
Well, you know, no suds, no save.	0
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.	4
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.	0
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.	4

Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.	0
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?	2
Oh, which museum?	0
No, answer his.	0
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.	1
She was totally at my mercy.	1
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?	3
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.	0
She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.	1
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would've killed in Albany.	4
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?	1

Why is your family	0
He cannot play at our wedding!	4

If you listen very carefully, I think its	0
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!	2
So do you think that these pictures... Are, are they trying to tell a story?	0
Oh, yeah, sure.	0
I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'	0
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.	0
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?	1
Yeah.	0
You see, now, I would date this girl.	0
She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.	0
I mean, that's got to come in handy	0
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?	0
I don't know.	0
Me neither.	0
Rachel.	0
What?!	2
I don't know.  Me neither.	0
Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.	3

Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?	0
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten	2
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.	2
Also an island.	0
Hey, what time is it?	0
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?	2
Are you serious?!	2
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.	0
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!	2
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!	4
Hey, you guys	0
Hey!	1
Who is it?	0
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!	1
Hey!	1
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.	2

You're making one right now!	4
And-	0
Yeah, can I help you with something?	0
Look, I'm talking right now! You're... you mean her.	1
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.	0

And stop using my name!	4
Hey!	1
Hi Pheebs!	1
Are you moving out?	0
No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.	0
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?	0
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.	0
Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,	5
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...	1
Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.	0
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.	0
Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!	2
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies	0
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.	2
Which proves that I never lie.	0
I guess you don't.	0
Paolo made a pass at me.	3
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.	5
I'm not freaking out.	0
Why would I be freaking out?	0
A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.	0
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!	4
I mean, what's the harm in that?	0
Right here!	3
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel	4
Phoebe and Rachel!	4
So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!	3
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.	3
Okay.	0
Really?	1
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready	0
I know! I know.	0
Okay.	0
I'm gonna go tell Joey that  that you're back. I was really worried about you.	4
Hey, did she buy it?	0
Totally.	0
So did Heldi show you the place?	0
Yeah, it's beautiful.	0
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!	1
I know.	0
Okay look, I have an idea.	0
Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.	0
And then whoever does gets the phone.	0
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.	0
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.	3
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.	3
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.	3
Joe.	0
Oh, I win! He's got	1
So you don't know that's	0
His new girlfriend!	2
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?	2
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.	3
She's saving the rest for her divorce.	4
And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to	0
Well what happened at dinner?	0
My parents spent the money for our wedding!	4
My God! What did you order?!	2
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!	3
Honey, it's gonna be okay.	0
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!	3
No, y'know what?	0
It's gonna be okay.	0
I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast.	0
Y'know?	0
And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.	0
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.	0
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.	0
I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.	0
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.	0
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.	0
Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division.	3
"Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"""	5
Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.	0
I'm Ross!	1
I'm divorced, and I have a kid!	1
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!	1
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.	4

Yeah, okay, Scott!	0
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.	5
So thanks for the warm welcome.	0
It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.	1
I hope you do too.	0
Now, let's go out there and get 'em!	1

Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody	1
You! Chuckles! What's your name?	0
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...	5

This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun.	1
Good to have you aboard Bing!	1
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.	0
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?	0
They're gonna call her Chandler.	0
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?	0
Works on you.	0
Oh, that is so sweet.	1
No, no, ok, you hang up.	1
Ok, ok, one, two, three.	1

OK, I need to lie down.	2
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!	1
Really? That's great!	1
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her	1
(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of	0
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,	1
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.	1
Ben is way cuter than that kid.	1
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?	0
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.	0
I look more like him than you do!	4
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.	1
That really was some of your best work.	1
Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.	0
I have to be up in seven minutes.	0
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes	0
Really?!	2
Do you wanna?	0
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!	1
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.	0
Boyfriend?	2
No.	0
I'm Joey.	0
Kristen.	0
Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?	1
Kristen.	0
Got it!  So	0
So uh, do you live around here?	0
Yeah!	0
Yeah!	1
Right down there.	0
Hey listen.. let me give you a little tip.	0
Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.	1
I'll remember that.	0
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?	0
Oh I, I have plans tonight.	0
But how about tomorrow?	0
Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?	1
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.	0
Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, I'll grab this one.	0
Hey.	0
Listen, um...	0
I'm sorry.	3
: Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'	0
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!	3
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.	0
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?	0
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.	4
You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.	3
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.	0
Oh, hello liar.	4
Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.	3
I could've been killed I hope you know!	4
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were	3
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.	1
Phoebe.	0
What?!  What the hell?!	4
All right, y'know what?	4
If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.	4
What?! Why?!	2
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar	4
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.	4
Great! Great!  You're making the bike very happy.	1
Okay Ross!  Please don't die!	4
How could you have kept all of this from me?	5
I was going to tell you, but	0
But what?! You figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!	4
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just...  Why don't we just let the machine get that?	4
Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.	0
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I... I need to, I need to lie down.	0
Everything on your application looks really good... Ohh!	1
Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?	4
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.	0
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?	1
You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I'll be living here.	1
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.	3
Why did you take the shower curtain down?	2
That thing was a hazard!  I'm very safety conscious.	5
Hi.	0
Hey man, how did the audition go?	0
Estelle said I didn't get it.	3
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!	2
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.	1
No!	2
For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around.	0
No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.	0
Right here.	0
Well, it's getting late.	0
Yeah, we're gonna go.	0
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?	0
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.	0
Yeah, it's a very large plane.	0
That's cool.	0
But, we'll stay here with you.	0
Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.	1
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.	2
They're not a couple!	2
Oh-okay, I get the game now.	0
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?	0
Oh yeah!	1
Well okay, so then you're fine.	0
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.	0
Okay?	0
So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.	0
It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.	0
Really?	2
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?	0
No.	0
Noooo!!	0
Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!	2
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.	0
Wait a second! So, what's new with you?	2
Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.	0
And your breasts! Hmm!!!	2
Okay.	0
Umm look, you're coming on a little strong.	5
But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.	0
So, why don't we just start over okay?	0
And you can just tell me about yourself.	0
All right.	0
Okay.	0
I write erotic novels, for children.	0
What?!	2
They're wildly unpopular.	0
Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.	0
Wow! You do?	2
Yeah,  a Pretty Huge	1
So, uh, how's she doing?	3
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.	3
How-how are you, Mom?	3
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?	4
What?	2
What's different?	2
Nothing.	0
Oh, maybe that's it.	0
She is unbelievable, our mother is...	4
Okay, relax, relax.	0
We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.	0
Oh God!	2
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.	0
Oh!	2
Oh, you know what I loved?	1
Her Sweet 'n' Los.	1
How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.	1
Not just restaurants, from our house.	0
Maybe.	0
You can't!	2
Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.	2
In the hall.	0
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.	0
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.	0
Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.	0
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.	0
That's a good one!	1
Hey, Joe.	0
Dad, Ronni's here.	0
Huh?	2
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal.	0
Anything at all.	0
But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.	0
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.	1
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!	4
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.	0
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut.  Hi!	4
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?	0
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A	4
"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers."	3
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?	1
Okay, you're fine.	0
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!	2
You'll see.	0
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.	1
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles	0
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and...  You go.	0
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time.	0
Really, it's fine, whatever you want.	0
It's perfect.	1
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain	1
Well then we'll get wet.	4
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.	3
Coming.	0
I have a bone to pick with you.	4
Uh-oh.	5
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.	4
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old	2
That's right! That's right!	1
Oh that.	0
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!	4
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!	4
Okay.	0
And if it were true, how	0
Ms. Monroe...  Oh there you go.	0
Mark's a genius!	2
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?	2
Look, don't you see what's happening here.	4
Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.	4
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.	0
What am I going to do?	5
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.	0
All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.	0
I don't know you guys.	5
And before you know it, she's with him.	4
And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'	4
And he'll be all, 'Yes!'	4
And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'	1
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?	0
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.	0
Great. Great.	0
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.	0
I'll be there.	0
Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.	0
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!	0
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of	0
Hey guys, what are you doing?	0
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.	0
Oh, come on!	3
Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.	0
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.	0
Well, Chandler will be there for you too.	0
I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there.	0
And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.	0
What do ya say? What do ya say?	0
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.	0
But, all right, I don't... maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.	0
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!	3
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.	3
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!	2
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...	1
What's that supposed to mean?	2
Nothing! It's an expression.	0
No it's not.	0
Don't listen to your mother.	0
You're independent, and you always have been!	0
Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!	0
And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...	0
PBS Telethon.	0
Hi Joey.	0
Hey Pheebs!	1
I	0
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what	2
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not	4
What kind of problem?	2
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!	3
Oh my God!	2
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!	3
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.	3
I don't wanna give up the bag.	3
I don't have to give up the bag!	4
Do I Rach?	3
Oh, you think I should give up the bag!	4
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it	0
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.	3
I can't believe I'm hearing this!	3
Wait a minute!	3
Wait a minute!	4
I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just... it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.	0
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.	0
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.	0
Okay, great.	1
They say he's only got half a tank left.	0
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!	2
We're switching rooms again.	4
What? Why?	2
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.	4
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.	1
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?	4
Uh-huh.	0
Chandler!	0
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!	4
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!	4
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?	2
Hey!	1
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.	2
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.	1
Well, I'm very glad you're here.	1
Oh, you're such a gentleman.  Come on! We're going to my place!	1
Hey!	1
Hey-hey.	0
So are guys doing okay?	0
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.	0
Do you have a minute?	0
Well yeah, sure, what's up?	0
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.	0
Oh really?!	2
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?	0
Oh, did you not want people to know that?	1
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.	1
Why's that?	0
I don't think I should say.	0
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.	0
Okay.	0
Kay.	0
Well	0
Yeah.	0
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.	0
Yeah, she's gay.	0
Here you go.	0
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.	1
Great!	1
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?	2
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.	0
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.	2
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.	0
What?	2
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!	4
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!	2
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?	2
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.	3
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.	4
But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.	0
You got all that from the back of her head?	2
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.	0
Who's Elaine?	0
Can you people not see me?!	1
So, will you talk to him?	0
I don't know Rach.	0
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free	4
One!  No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!	4
Hey!	1
Hi!	1
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?	0
We need a porn break.	0
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.	0
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?	1
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.	0
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.	1
Hey!	1
Hi!	1
Well, what-what 'cha got there?	1
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked.	1
Ahh!	0
Now, I know what you're thinking	0
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?	5
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?	2
No!	1
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.	0
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.	0
What's the second part of your plan?	0
Yes that's right.	0
Why?	2
I tired attacking two women, did not work.	0
What?!	2
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends.	0
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.	4
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!	4
Oh, no!	2
No-no!	2
No, I tired!	2
But I couldn't.	0
That's why I'm here.	4
Maybe we could attack them together?	0
That-that's a no.	0
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!	3
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!	4
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!	4
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.	4
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.	0
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.	0
I like that.	1
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.	0
Huh?	0
One swift kick and he'll back off.	0
All right, bad ankle, got it!	0
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.	0
Yeah.	0
And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.	0
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!	1
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.	0
But-but, Liam's on my team.	1
I don't care! You just get him!	4
I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!	1
The Red Ross! Okay.	1
Oh!  Oh by the way?	0
Uh-hmm.	0
James Brolin?	0
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.	0
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.	0
Really?!	2
Hello?	0
Hello, is Ross there?	0
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?	0
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.	0
Ross got married again... Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!	2
Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!	1
Oh!  She's growing inside you.	0
Whoa!!	2
Oh!	2
Wow that was a big one.	2
I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.	1
Oh hey you guys!	1
Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya.  What uh... How come you're not going?	0
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.	0
I thought you already have a job.	0
And people say you don't pay attention.	0
No, this is a much better job.	0
It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.	0
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!	2
That's what I do now.	0
Hey Joey, come taste this.	0
What is it?	0
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well...  I'm getting my revenge!	4
You cooked him?	2
No.	0
He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.	0
Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!	1
"""Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."""	1
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?	3
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?	0
We're never gonna find anybody.	3
Well then let me do it!	1
Joe	1
No-no-no!	0
Look, I've been thinking about it.	0
I'm an actor right?	0
So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.	0
I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts!	4
Everyone knows I'm an ass man!	1
That is true.	0
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.	1
It'll be me!	1
And I swear I'll do a really good job.	1
Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.	1
It might be kinda cool.	1
So I can do it?	1
Ah-ha! Too cocky!	1
I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.	5
Of course I do! And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.	0
What the hell is that?	4
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?	2
You said there was a gas leak in here.	0
Well why don't you use your key?	0
Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.	0
If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.	0
Come on!	4
Hurry up.	3
Oh! We could have done that.	0
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.	0
Oh, I'm so sorry.	3
Um, and maybe I'm wrong!	3
I but... y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.	0
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?	2
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.	0
Oh, but it's made her so happy.	4
Little girl misses her cat.	0
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.	3
Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.	0
Yeah.	0
Thank you.	0
I	0
He is right, isn't he?	1
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.	0
You think?	2
Oh-no, he's right.	0
Seven hundred bucks!	1
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?	1
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.	1
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?	0
Oh.	0
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.	0
Me too.	0
Although this city is my home, so.	0
So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that.	0
Umm, you make something up.	0
Nice,  thank you.	1
This is me.	0
Here.	0
Your eyes are very pretty.	1
Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!	1
He would like to kiss you.	0
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now.	0
No-no-no-no!!	1
Not him, you don't!	2
Well the moment's over.	0
Oh.	0
Oy!	0
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?	4
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.	0
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.	0
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.	2
Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.	4
Oh, you want something serious.	0
Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.	0
Those are dead serious.	0
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.	4
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.	5
Why not?!	2
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...	0
What is the thing?	3
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.	3
What?	2
They were in his office.	0
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.	3
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.	4
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.	2
Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?	1
How are you feeling?	0
You are	0
I really wish that you wouldn't.	4
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?	0
Then we can put you in bed, okay?	0
Just smile and don't talk to	0
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?	1
Pheebs!!	1
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!	1
Speech! Come on Monica!	1
Come on!	1
Come on! Speech!	1
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!	4
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.	1
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.	0
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.	1
Oh crap!	4
All right.	0
The super couldn't figure out what it did.	0
A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did.	3
I've had seven pretty serious shocks.	3
Thank God.	1
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.	1
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.	4
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?	3
He doesn't have anyone.	0
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.	4
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!	1
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.	0
You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.	0
Y'know, we don't have to watch this.	0
No way, forget it.	1
C'mon, she's your mom!	4
Exactly.	0
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!	1
I love her books!	1
I cannot get on a plane without one!	1
I mean, this is so cool!	1
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.	1
Thank you.	0
And a nice hot cider for Monica.	0
Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?	0
Yeah?	0
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?	2
Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!	2
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?	0
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!	4
Yeah I can, it worked real well.	0
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.	4
I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.	4
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!	4
What?!	2
Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.	4
Who are you talking too?	2
I am	0
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!	4
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.	5
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!	0
Shh! Get me out of here.	5
Oh.	0
Ross!	2
What?	0
Come here, check this out!	2
What? Is it the comet?	0
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.	2
Joey come... I can't believe... I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!	4
Y'know, there's	0
Show me where?	0
Right-right up here.	0
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?	0
I don't know!   Yeah, I do.	1
Joey!	4
What?! All right... Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid	4
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!	4
Oh no! No! No!	2
Wow! This place is incredible!  Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!	1
Hi!	0
Hi!	0
I'm Trudie.	0
Uh-huh.	0
You must be Ben's mum.	0
Why else would I be here?	0
Do sit down.	0
Yeah.	0
Hi.. how was the game?	0
Well..	0
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!	1
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?	2
Alan.	0
He was unbelievable.	1
He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...	1
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.	1
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..	1
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..	0
What?	2
..I dunno, a little too Alan?	0
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.	1
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.	1
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.	1
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade,	1
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?	5
What the hell!	2
Okay.	0
All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?	0
My God!	2
These pants are burning up!	2
Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!	2
What is she trying to kill me?	4
It's like a volcano in here!	2
Are you hot?	0
Okay, it must just be me then.	0
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?	0
You're driving me crazy with that!	4
Okay, I'll stop.	0
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!	4
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.	4
You wanna play?	0
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.	0
And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.	0
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.	0
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?	1
I'm intrigued.	0
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.	0
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.	1
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.	1
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?	0
Uh yeah, right here.	0
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?	1
What's that?	0
Weeeell, it's rum, and-	0
I'm sure they'll be here soon.	0
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.	0
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.	0
You are really frightening me.	5
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?	5
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.	0
All right, honey, time to start pushing.	0
But they're not here yet!	5
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.	0
Oh, god.	5
Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.	1
Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.	0
Aw, we-we are so... So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you.	1
And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.	1
Okay.	0
I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun.	0
It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right?	1
So where-where is it going?	0
Ah!	2
That's-that's the real question.	0
And-and the answer is...is it's going somewhere...fun.	1
Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger.	0
No I mean... No not you, not you, you... you	5
I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?	3
Y'know what?	0
I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.	1
I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .	1
No?	4
Really?	2
They taste so good.	1
Drum roll.	0
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?	0
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.	0
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.	0
You're actually going through with this?	2
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.	4
Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.	0
You got problems because of you!	4
Not your name!	3
All right, this has got to stop!	4
Chandler is a great name!	4
In fact... yes,  I'm, I'm sorry.	3
I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.	0
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!	2
It was.	0
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.	3
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?	2
No.	0
Whoa. That was really good.	2
Thanks, any suggestions?	0
You-you...you had sex with Ursula?!	2
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and	5
You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!	2
Well I was just so excited to see you.	3
No-no it's not!	3
I don't want to lose you!	5
It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you... Yeah it is too weird.	3
So I guess this is it.	3
Yeah.  Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.	3
Yeah, so do you.	4
Hey!	1
Hi.	0
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?	0
Manhattan does not have enough stores.	3
Well,	0
You can?	2
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.	0
Um-hmm.	0
And a small piece of chocolate.	0
Okay.	0
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship	3
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!	5
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.	1
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.	3
Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?	2
No! No! Not, Paris.	0
Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?	1
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!	4
When?	4
I don't know exactly.	0
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.	3
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.	1
Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that's him! That's him!	1
Great! Go get him.	1
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.	0
He's not really my type.	0
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.	0
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.	3
You do attract some stinkers.	3
Chandler.	0
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a	0
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.	0
Oh, listen.	0
If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.	0
Really.	1
Nothing at all.	0
Really.	1
Nothing.	0
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?	0
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?	3
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.	3
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?	0
No, no, I keep trying, y'know?	4
"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too..."" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""...go to the bathroom."""	3
He may think I'm sick.	0
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with!	0
Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them.	0
That's it.	0
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?	1
Pretty much.	0
All right.	0
Hey Monica!	1
Hi!	1
Hey man, you feeling any better?	0
Joey, we have something to tell you.	0
Oh my God! You're pregnant!	2
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.	0
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.	0
Really?!	2
Yeah!	0
Oh my God!... Eh! Well	2
He's gonna go up to the counter with	0
Yeah.	0
I missed this.	1
Me too.	4
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?	0
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!	1
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.	4
We will.	0
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.	0
No Mon,	0
Every year.	0
Hey! Ross!	1
Die Hard	0
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?	0
What'd you rent?	0
Die Hard 2	0
Joey, this is	0
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its	0
Joey, we	0
And?	0
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!	1
Die Hard	0
Dude, you didn't say	0
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.	0
Well, John McClane had plans!	4
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.	0
What are you talking about? Bitch.	4
I know you botched that operation on purpose.	1
I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.	4
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!	1
Stop going through my stuff !	4
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.	4
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.	5
Please, what about you and Chandler?	4
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!	4
Well hello !	4
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?	0
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!	4
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.	0
I'm gonna do it.	1
And I can't stop you.	0
No.	0
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?	0
I'm smarter than	0
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.	1
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.	1
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.	0
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.	0
Sure.  Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.	1
No.	0
No, thank you.	0
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.	0
I'd love an ice water.	0
You got it.	0
Joey, what are you doing?	2
Just being friendly.	4
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.	4
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?	0
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.	4
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.	3
Joey, do you work here?	2
No.	0
Hey, waiter.	0
Yeah?	0
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening.  Yeah we are.	0
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.	0
I'm calling for Monica Geller.	0
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available	0
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groom... No! Not the groom!!	2
Thank you.	0
Thanks.	0
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!	4
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am	0
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.	3
So go fix it!	0
Go find Chandler!	0
He's probably up in your room!	3
Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.	4
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!	1
Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!	1
Anybody lose this?	0
Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!	1
Hmm.	0
Do you remember where the duck food is?	0
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?	2
Because I'm going to London.	0
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?	2
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.	0
Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.	0
I... Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!	5
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.	5
But I have to tell him how I feel!	3
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.	0
That's not why you're going!	3
"You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach."	3
"Forget that British chippy."""	3
Ohh... Do you think he will?!	2
No!	3
Because he's in love with the British chippy!	3
Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!	4
Y'know, it's too late!	4
You missed you're chance!	3
I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.	3
"Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, ""I do."""	4
I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.	1
So is everybody here?	0
I got here a little early myself.	0
Let us begin.	0
Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.	0
Here.	0
Here.	0
Now as for the hydrosaurs	0
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.	0
I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry.	3
So, do you think you can forgive me?	3
Great.	1
Thanks.	1
Okay, bye.	0
Hello, Jennifer?	0
Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?	2
Oh, she's not home huh?	2
Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.	0
Hey!	4
Hi.	0
Are you all right?	0
Uhh... I think I just got engaged.	5
Oh my God! He did it?	2
Well, did you know he was gonna ask me?	1
Are you kidding?	2
I'm like the one who talked him into it.	1
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.	3
And you really think this is a good idea?	3
I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.	0
I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.	3
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.	2
Really?! Even Ross?	2
Especially Ross!	1
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh you know what? I'll-I'll come  back later.	0
There he goes, your fiancee.	1
I guess so.	0
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.	0
I can't say that I'm surprised.	0
Oh, that is so unfortunate.	3
What?	0
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.	1
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.	0
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.	0
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.	0
Bye-bye!  That's why I moved out.	1
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.	0
I think on some levels she already knows.	0
Night Mon. Night Julio.	0
Look Julio, someone left their book here.	2
Ah actually, that is mine.	0
Oh yeah, what are you reading?	0
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?	0
Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?	0
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.	0
Your a poet and don't know it.	0
Actually I ah, I am a poet.	0
Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?	0
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.	0
Mine?  Right here?	0
I can write an epic poem about this lip.	1
How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.	1
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.	0
What?	2
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.	0
What?	2
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?	0
Are we really in Montreal?!	2
Yes we are. So, coffee?	0
Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?	0
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.	0
Okay, here's batch 22.	0
Oh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's.	4
This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.	0
Let's give it a shot.	0
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?	2
No, just a Friday night.	0
Would she?	0
Would she?  You ate my candy bar!	4
I know honey, I'm sorry.	3
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.	3
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!	1
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't....	3
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?	4
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....	5
It's not funny, this is actually my job.	4
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.	0
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here.	1
And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.	1
Ah, just one other thing.	0
Yes?!	1
I ah, I work at	0
Do you want my pickle?	0
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?	0
Why?	2
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.	0
Oh my God.	2
Phoebe.	0
Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.	0
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.	1
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.	4
We should do something. Whistle.	1
We are not going to whistle.	4
Come on, do it.	0
No!	4
Do it!	1
No!	4
Do it do it do it!	1
Woo-woo!	1
I can't believe you did that!	2
Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.	0
Still?	2
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.	0
I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.	1
Either eat it, or be in it.	4
Spoon?  So, what do you think?	1
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. there's a new class comin' in.	1
Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?	0
I can.	0
Okay, go ahead.	0
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.	0
That's very good, what's your name?	0

Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!	1
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention	0
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?	0
We can't. We're not pharmacists!	3

Kate Miller?	0
Kate Miller it is.	0
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.	1
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?	0
Thank you.	0
Oh my God!	2
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.	3
This year was supposed to be great!	4
No. No, you're not a loser.	3
Look at me!	4
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!	1
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.	3
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.	1
That really is something.. that's really cool.	1
Howdy partner!	1
Maybe I should get another pair!	1
Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.	1
I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.	1
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.	1
I would make a good cowboy.	1
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.	0
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.	0
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!	4
Oh yeah!	2
Great nap.	0

Hey, how you doin'?	0
Hey Mikey	0

To kill Bob??	2
No, no, to test his neck strength.	0
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!	4
I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.	3
Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.	0
I'll find Bob, I'll get him.	0

Oh yeah, no problem.	0
Thanks.	0
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.	3
Joey!	2
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!	2
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!	4
So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.	4
"I said, ""No!"""	4
Which puts	0
Great. So the ball is in his court?	4
Ball? There is no ball.	4
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?	2

Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and	0
Oh great! That	4
Do-do you, do you have brothers?	0
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.	0
Are you close with them?	0
No-no, they're not very nice people.	0
Okay, listen, I really like you.	0
Okay?	0
I think this can go somewhere.	0
So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?	0
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of	0
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!	0
What?	2
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.	0
It's over.	3
Oh, was it awful?	3
Well, it was loong.	3
I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head.	0
Anyway, she didn't want to stay.	3
I called a cab. she just left.	0
I wrote you a letter.	0
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.	1
It's just some things I've been thinking about.	0
Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.	0
Okay.  Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning.  So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.	0
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.	0
Okay, I'll be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.	1
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!	4
Well, you said that we except the	0
All right, that I'll retract.	0
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.	4
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?	2
Lebanon.	0
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.	4
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.	0
Okay, then what happened?	0
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!	4
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?	0
Nothing!   This is not over!	4

I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in...  Actually, thanks!	3
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?	0
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.	3
Really?	2
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.	3
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.	0
That's okay, Joe.	0
All right, let's go Pheebs.	0
Oh God!	2
That was amazing.	1
I know.	0
Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?	1
We may have just started a family.	1
Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.	1
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.	0
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!	4
I knew it!	2
I knew it!	4
I always knew she liked him!	4
Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are!	4
Right?	0
We just broke up, first thing she does!	4
You didn't just break up.	0
Hey, it's been like three weeks!	4
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?	0
Oh yeah!	1
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily.	1
Well, there's this one thing... Okay,  here goes.	0
I made a promise that--Oh hey!	2
What?	0
You're nose is bleeding!	2
Oh God.	3
No!	3
Oh not again!	4
This-this happened when my grandfather died.	3
Sorry.	3
Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?	0
Umm	0
Sorry. Sorry.	3
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.	3
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.	0
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!	5
Hello, Chip.	0
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?	1
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at	1
So ah, Monica ready yet?	0
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?	0
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?	2
That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.	1
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?	2
He's talking to the baby.	0
Ohh!	2
Okay!	2
"Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can't wait to hear your first words,"" I thought, ""There's a trick."""	2
Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.	0
Okay.	0
Oh my, oh my God!	2
Aw, it's unbelievable!	2
Wow!	2
She is kicking so much!	2
Oh, she's like umm...oh...who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?	1
Mia Hamm?	0
Mia Hamm!	1
Oh that's amazing.	1
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!	2
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!	2
Okay, what do you guys think?	0
Dude!	2
I have never known love like this.	3
You really like it?	2
Dude! How-how did you write this?	2
I stole Monica's and changed the name.	0
You can't	0
If he goes first he can!	1
Yeah!	4
Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know?	0
Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.	0
Oh wow that's a great idea! And	1
Here you go.	0
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.	1
Here you go.	0
Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just... I don't get Chandler.	0
Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.	0
All the time?	3
All the time!	4
Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.	0
I'm all done.	0
Thank God.	1
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.	0
Oh right.	0
Right.	0
Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried?	1
We're probably too old to do that now.	3
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.	1
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.	1
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?	2
Well I'm, I'm a little slow.  Just as our children would be.	0
Relax every muscle in your body.	0
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.	0
Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.	0
Okay, tell me your happy place.	0
Richard's living room, drinking wine.	1
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!	4
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.	3
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.	0
Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.	0
All right, I'll try not to.	0
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....	0
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?	3
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....	1
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.	3
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.	0
Okay.	0
Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.	1
And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....	0
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.	0
See you later Rach.	0
Bye-bye Julie.	0
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.	1
Hey?	0
What?	0
Can I ask you somethin'?	0
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.	1
Ok.	0
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?	0
What's up?	0
F.Y.I..	0
I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.	0
Her name is Stephanie... something.	0
She's supposed to be very good.	0
But what about Phoebe?	2
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.	3
Uh...	0
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?	5
Ahh, no.	3
Oh.	0
Are you jealous?	2
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.	4
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?	4
You are totally jealous.	1
I'm not jealous.	4
All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.	0
And y'know, and um, I...	0
Honey, I love you too.	0
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.	3
What?	2
Huh.	2
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.	1
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.	0
I can't believe you came back.	2
Don't say anything.	1
I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think.	0
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.	1
Rachel! Rachel!	1
What?	0
You missed the exit!	2
Oh, sorry.	0
My God, what were you thinking about?	2
Um,  Barry.	0
Awwwww	1
I just... I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!	2
Dude!	1
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.	1
God!	2
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!	1
Well actually, Ross doesn't.	0
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.	0
Dear Mary-Angela.	0
Hi.	0
How?s it going.	0
This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.	3
How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?	4
Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba.	0
All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person.	0
At least you know her name.	0
You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.	0
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?	5
Where in Cuba?	3
Hey.	0
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.	3
Oh! I knew it! What happened?	2
Umm, she kissed me.	3
What?! You kissed!	2
All right.	0
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?	0
A two and a five.	0
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!	1
Really?!	2
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again.  What do you got?	0
A four and a nine.	0
You're kidding right?	2
No. Why?	0
Well that's a full cup!	2
Damn! I am good at Cups!	1
What? Why? Where are you?	2
I'm still on the set!	0
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!	4
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.	3
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.	3
No! No, I'm the minister! Alright, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.	4
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.	3
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!	4
Oh hey Joey! What's up?	1
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?	0
Yeah, I've been around.	0
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?	0
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.	0
Great! Problem solved!	1
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.	3
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.	0
Why?	2
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.	3
Bastard!	4
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or... Oh!	2
All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!	2
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.	1
Oh, I can't believe it!	2
I mean I think it's great!	1
For him.	0
She might be able to do better.	0
Hey guys!	0
Joey! Come here! Come here!	0
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.	0
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?	0
No. Joey, she	0
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?	2
Yes, but y'know what?	0
It doesn't matter who knows what.	0
Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!	0
Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!	1
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.	0
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.	0
You really think it would be that different?	2
How could it not be?	2
I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.	3
And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a	3
Well, things change.	0
I don't want them to move to a	3
It'll be okay Joe.	0
Its still there!	2
Mrs. Braverman must be out.	0
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.	3
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.	5
No that could kill her.	5
Well, we don't want that.	0
No, so we're protecting her.	0
But we should take it.	0
But we should move quick.	5
Why?	2
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.	5
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!	5
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?	0
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.	0
Well, you're gonna.	0
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...	0
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?	0
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.	0
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?	3
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...	0
Hey, you're not him.	0
You're you.	0
When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?	0
No.	0
No.	0
You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.	0
Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!	0
"And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""	0
You really think so?	1
Yeah. I really do.	0
Thanks, Chandler.	0
Get off!	4
Hi.	0
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?	0
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?	0
And the cream?	0
Cheese makes me thirsty.	0
Okay. Let's move on.	0
All right.	0
Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?	2
Oh no!	2
I don't know anything about cooking.	0
I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.	0
Well, hats off to the chef.	1
I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?	0
The chef!	1
That's right.	1
Hey, Pheebs.	0
Hey.	0
How's it going?	0
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.	1
So what's going on?	0
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.	0
I dunno, there's just something about...	0
Basically we just feel that he's...	0
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.	3
Uh-huh.	0
Okay.	0
Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?	0
We're sorry.	3
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
What are you doing?	0
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.	0
Yes that was mine.	5
Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.	0
Yes that would have made more sense.	3
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!	4
All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.	0
And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.	0
Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?	4
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?	4
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.	0
She said what?	2
"She said, ""If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."""	0
Postpone it?	1
Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?	4
Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?	4
This isn't right.	0
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.	3
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?	4
Don't you point your pants at me!	4
We have no choice!	4
Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand?	4
This is our wedding I'm talking about.	4
The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.	0
So what are you saying? It's now or never?	4
No. I'm saying it's now.	0
Or?	4
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!	4
It's not the pants.	4
It's you that is backwards.	4
And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!	4
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please...	3
Hi, honey.	0
See you later.	0
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!	1
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!	4
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.	0
Oh no!	2
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available	0
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!	5
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!	2
NOOOO!!!!!!!!	4
Ma! What're you doing here?	2
I came to give you this  and this.	0
Oww! Big ring!	2
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.	0
Do you uh, do you talk about me?	0
Yeah, yeah, all the time.	0
Really?	2
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.	0
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap	4
Check this out. Can I have this?	0
What?	0
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.	0
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.	0
It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.	1
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.	3
Fortunately, it is me.	1
And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.	1
Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.	1
Y'know, someplace nice.	0
Yeah, someplace nice.	0
Yeah!	1
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?	0
So, what do you think?	0
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.	1
I know!	1
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?	0
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!	1
Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!	1
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.	0
Gotcha.	0
This place is really my Grandmother's.	0
I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.	0
So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR.	0
So are you thirsty?	0
Oh, you bet I am!	1
Okay, here's your penis!	2
Ohh, okay.	0
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.	1
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.	0
Hey, ready for dinner?	0
Ooh, absolutely!	1
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?	1
Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.	0
How about Mama Lisettie's?	0
Enh. Sure!	0
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!	0
That... this milk is mine.	0
I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.	0
Okay, let's go!	1
Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the	4
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.	0
Okay, stop!	4
Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?	0
Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?	4
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.	0
Thank you.	1
Go!	0
Go!	4
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!	3

Yeah.	0
God, what a mess.	0
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.	0
Well, I lost.	3
Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.	3
Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.	4
Hey! How'd the interview go?	1
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.	3
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.	3
That's not how that was supposed to come out.	3
This is the worst Christmas ever.	3
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.	0
I can't!	4
It's too late!	4
Terry already hired that girl over there.	3
Look at her, she's even got waitress experience.	3
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.	3
That word was swans.	0
What do we got there?	2
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture... Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!	2
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.	1
It's all right.	0
It's all right.	0
You don't have to explain.	0
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.	0
You're our third call tonight.	0
Really?	2
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.	0
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.	3
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.	0
Thank God. Food.	1
Phoebe?	0
What?	0
Do you have a plan?	0
I don't even have a 'pl'.	1
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.	3
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'	2
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?	2
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?	1
And-and a power tie?	1
Oh God.	2
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!	2
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?	0
Big Bird's friend.	0
I see pizza!	1
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!	1
Hello? Who are we spying on?	3
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?	0

Aww, thank you.	1
Okay, who's next?!	0
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.	0

Hi! And you're going into what grade?	2
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early	1
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.	1
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to	1
Shh!	4
Doogie, shh!	4
Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon?	2
Huh?	2

Need some help?	0
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!	4
Your license please.	0

Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.	1
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk	0
Sure.	0
No problem.	0
You have to give 'em something, you know.	1
Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?	0
Petrie.	0
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working	0

Right?	4

Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.	4
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.	1
717?  Where's 717?  Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?	2
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.	0
Ross, thank God.	1
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?	2
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.	1
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.	5
Oh, now you want a favour?	1
Yes, please.	0
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?	4
Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.	0
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.	4
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk.	0
So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.	4
No, Rachel doesn't want me to....	4
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.	0
Yeah, you're right.	0
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.	3
Oh, I know.	3
I kinda feel like it's my fault.	3
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.	4
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!	4
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.	4
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.	0
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?	4
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.	4
Okay, I admit it!	4
I love this coat!	1
Okay, I... it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!	1
Remember Phil Huntley?	0
He was fine!	1
So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!	1
Oh no	5
I'd better go. (She goes and sits down in the	0
Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.	3
I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!	4
Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?	0
Rachel!	4
All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.	5
Okay!	4
Okay.	0
Thank you!	4
That's it?!	4
You call that a fight?	2
Come on!	4
"""We were on a break!"""	4
"""No we weren't!"""	4
What happened to you two?	2
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?	0
I'm sorry.	0
But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.	0
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.	0
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.	0
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the	2
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.	0
Is this because of the burrito thing?	3
You need to give him money.	0
Give him money? It was a joke!	2
No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.	4
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.	0
You've got to be smooth about it.	0
Hey, I can be smooth.	0
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.	0
Of course, sir.	0
Okay.	0
I'd better get back to my desk.	0
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.	1
My what?	2
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.	0
But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.	0
Are you serious?	2
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?	0
I can blow dry it.	0
I can put gel on it.	0
It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.	0
Does it bug you?	3
Is there any chance you didn't see that?	0
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?	0
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?	0
No.	0
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?	1
Joey, did	0
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.	1
Joey,  where did you learn that word?	2
Where do you think,  Zelda?	0
You found my book?!	4
Yeah I did!	1
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!	4
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!	2
Hey-hey, y'know what?	4
There's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little...erotica.	0
It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.	4
You got porn!	1
Well, I feel like a snack!	1
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.	0
Oh no thanks. I don't like	0
What?!	2
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.	3
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.	0
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!	4
How did you know about that?!	2
Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Come in.	0
Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and	0
Great!	1
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match.	0
Okay, so I made up a little test.	0
Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.	0
I can do that.	0
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.	0
Fight.	0
Very good! Okay. G.	1
String?	0
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.	1
Kitten?	0
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but... bye-bye!	3
Monica, leave him alone	4
Will you hurry up?	3
Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?!	2
And that they're going to be drinking alot!	4
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.	0
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?	4
Joey!	4
Come on!	4
I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright?	4
This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like 'Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?'	5
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?	0
Oh I am!	1
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!	4
Okay, fine!	4
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?	0
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.	0
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?	1
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.	1
Okay, now you're even cuter!!	1
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.	0
What?	2
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.	2
What are you talking about?	2
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.	1
That's not possible!	1
Ow!	2
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.	1
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.	4
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.	3
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!	4
This bicep?	2
Well it's not flexed right now!	4
It's Phoebe.	0
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?	3
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.	3
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.	3
No you didn't!	1
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?	4
anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years.	0
He was my first client when I became a party planner.	0
He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.	0
Oh well.	0
And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.	0
Oh. Oh, that's great!	1
Really? Like how?	2
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.	0
That's a good one.	1
Yeah? You like that one?	2
Yeah, you're funny.	1
I'm funny?	2
Oh thank God!	1
Well hey, I've got a ton of these!	1
Umm, oh here... Do you want a good one?	0
Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.	0
Right?	0
And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.	0
And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.	0
Can I do it to you?	0
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?	1
Chloe? Hi..	0
Is this about me taking your watch?	3
You took my watch?	2
I'm sorry, I do that.	3
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?	3
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.	0
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.	0
Yeah. That-that was the problem.	0
Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!	1
Bing! You got those numbers for me?	1
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?	0
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?	0

Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time.	0
Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire, J.T., Beardsley.	0
Is that all?	0
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.	1
Ohh, how is he?	2
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.	0
Isn't he an architect now?	0
Yeah, they still wear underwear.	0
So the Porsche guy took his car back.	0
But you found the keys to his clothes?	0
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.	1
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?	2
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!	0
Hey!	1
Oh! It's you.  Hi.	2
What about me?! You-you just said I could!	4
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!	0
I can't believe you're not picking me.	4
Hey, how can it	0
I'm not even... I'm not even	0
Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.	4
Yes!  Shame about you man.	1
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.	1
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.	3
Wh-what?! Why?!	2
It's a money thing, we don't have any.	3
You're kidding right?	2
No.	0
What?!	2
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.	0
Uh, hang out?! How long?	3
I don't know.	0
A week?	4
Maybe two?	0
The money will turn up!	0
People will always wanna invest in movies!	0
Hey, you're not rich are ya?	0

Eh, worth a shot.  Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?	0
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?	0

Hey.	0
Hey!	1
So how was Joan?	0
I broke up with her.	0
Don't tell me, because of the big nostril thing?	2
Come on, they were not that huge.	0
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?	2
Hold it, hold it.	0
I gotta side with Chandler on this one.	0
You or me?	0
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.	0
You guys are messing with me, right?	2
Yeah.	0
"That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa."""	1
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.	3
What?	2
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.	0
You're a genius!	1
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!	3
Now, there's two reasons.	0
Hey.	0
Hey!	1
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.	0
Where?!	2
On the touchy.	0
And	0
No, I know!	2
I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.	4
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.	0
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get	1
Thank you, Joey.	0
No-no, thank you.	0
Hey Estelle, listen	0

Really?!	2
Yeah!	1
Oh well, no harm, no foul.	0
Okay, you guys free tonight?	0
Yeah!!	1
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.	2
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?	0
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.	0
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars.	2
What exactly were you looking for, hmm?	0
Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?	0
Uhh....	0
Ah... Ah...Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?	4
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far too progressionist.	0
I find Marion's views far too progressionist.	0
I'm sorry, who are you?	2
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.	0
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh... Wait!  Did you write this?	2
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!	2
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.	2
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.	0
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.	4
What?	2
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.	4
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?	4
The point is I...	4
I don't need this right now, OK.	4
It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy.	4
This ship has sailed.	4
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.	4
Fine.	4
Cause I don't need your stupid ship.	4
Good.	4
Good.	4
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.	1
Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.	0
All in good time my love.	0
All in good time.	0
Oh shoot!	2
I left my guitar in their apartment.	3
Well you can let me in later.	0
I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.	0
What?! They took mine to give to you!	2
Why would they take away our keys?	2
Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.	1
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.	1
A	0
No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.	0
Uh, what?	2
Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.	1
What... You're not serious.	2
I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her.	4
Hi Ross!	1
Hi roomie!	1
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?	0
I don't know!	0
It's not like it's porn!	0
This is a serious, legitimate movie.	0
And the nudity is really important to the story.	0
That's what you say about porn.	0
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.	0
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!	1
Well that's true.	0
And I am only naked in one scene.	0
Plus it sounds really great.	0
My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.	0
Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.	0
So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.	0
It's really sweet and-and tender.	1
Hey, what's up?	0
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.	3
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.	0
"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!"	1
Yeah?	0
I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know?	0
Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me.	0
And what's more different than me. A guy who's	0
So where are we going next?	0
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.	0
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?	5
Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?	1
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!	4
Yeah, no one talks like that!	4
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!	4
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!	4
How do you figure that?	0
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!	0
I guess so.	0
Here you go. Thank you!	0
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?	0
Oh what, you-you want both of them?	2
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!	4
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it.	5
I know it's in the apartment, but I	0
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!	5
Tell her to wear her own earrings.	4
These	0
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!	4
Why not?	0
Because I lose her stuff!	4
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?	0
Yeah!	0
What's going on?	0
Chandler's gone again!	2
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!	3
Okay. You ready to push again?	0
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.	4
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!	1
Yeah!!	1
Little Leslie is here!	1
We got another one!	2
Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children.	2
How scary is that?	2
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!	1
All right, he's coming. He's coming!	1
Hey, where's his thing?	2
Chandler's a girl!	2
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.	2
They musta read the sonogram wrong.	2
Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl!	2
Chandler's a girl!	2
Okay, keep saying it!	1
Am I too late?!	0
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.	1
We have our babies?	2
Yeah.	1
Oh, we have our babies.	1
Hey Toby!	1
Hey Bobby.	0
It's Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler	0
Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?	0
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.	4
Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.	3
Toby don't.	3
Bob!	3
Toby! I'm not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!	4
Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!	1
I know! I found it on the street.	1
Are you serious... Really?! It's in such good condition.	2
Yeah.	0
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?	2
I don't know.	0
It's moving.	5
It's still... ... It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!	5
Ooh! Ah! Okay!	5
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing	0
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So	3
Oh just say it Kyle!	2
We're gonna give it another try.	1
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!	4
I'm gonna work on that.	0
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.	4
Y'know, he hums when he pees!	4
I do know.	0
We're so sorry.	3
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.	4
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.	4
Yeah, we're gonna go.	0
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she	3
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.	0
Yeah, we're better off without them.	4
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!	4
Divorced men's club.	3
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?	4
Maybe because you've got the keys?	4
This is totally your fault!	4
My fault?! You threatened the judge!	4
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!	4
Phoebe!	0
Yeah?	0
Have you seen Chandler?!	0
No! Why?	0
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!	5
I know!	5
How bad is this?	5
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!	5
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!	5
What are you gonna do?	0
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure!	4
"""Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"""	0
Rachel said that!	2
Well Rachel's not here!	4
Come on, come on.	0
Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.	4
This is all your fault.	4
This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?	4
My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.	4
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.	4
No no no, believe me.	4
No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?	4
And you know what the funny thing is?	0
When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?	4
Where does that leave me?	3
You get to be the baby's father.	0
Everyone knows who you are.	0
Who am I?	4
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.	3
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.	0
This is so great.	1
You wanna explain that?	0
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.	3
And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.	1
And it's not even born yet.	3
It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.	1
I'm sorry, you were fighting.	3
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.	0
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?	0
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!	1
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can	0
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!	2
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.	0
I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...	0
You know he's gay?	0
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?	0
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.	0
Hi. Hi.	0
What are you doing here?	2
Well, what?	0
What?	0
What is it?	0
That she left you?	2
That she likes women?	0
That she left you for another woman that likes women?	0
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...	4
Then what?	0
My first time with Carol was...	0
What?	0
It was my	0
With Carol?  Oh.	2
So in your whole life, you've only been with one... ... oh.	2
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!	2
Hi. Where is everybody?	0
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?	3
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.	3
Oh no! Why?	2
Cause Carol's a lesbian.  And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.	3
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.	2
I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!	3
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?	0
Well, now I do!!	2
I'm sorry.	3
Seven years.	3
I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....	3
Aw, God Ross. Oh.	3
I'll do it.	0
No you won't.	0
Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry.	3
But,  you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.	0
Okay, absolutely!	1
All right.	0
You've got it.	0
Cookie, now you can punch him!	4
What?!	2
All right, that's it, I quit.	4
What? I didn't say anything.	2
Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.	4
Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.	4
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.	3
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.	4
Julie.	0
What?!	2
Jody!	2
You were with Julie?	0
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.	0
And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.	0
Oh. Oh my God.	2
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.	3
Yeah, right. Sure!	4
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.	3
Look, I'm sorry, all right.	3
I never meant for you to find out!	3
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.	4
That is not true!	4
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?	4
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?	4
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to	3
Yeah!	2
I can't say.	0
Why?!	2
Why not?	3
I can't say because he's famous.	0
Oh my God, who is it?!	2
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.	4
Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.	0
As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?	2
What?! Well he never said that to me!	2
In	0
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.	3
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.	1
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.	0
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.	0
Oh, let's not tell this story.	3
Oh, come on!	3
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!	1
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!	2
Hey, it's not like it sounds.	0
It's	0
Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!	4
Who was that?	0
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.	3
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.	3
Ten dollars an hour.	0
No.	0
Twelve dollars an hour.	0
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.	0
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.	4
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour.	4
Done.	1
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!	5
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!	5
No! I won't leave you!	5
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!	3
No you're not! Not to me!	4
Oh my God.	2
What?	0
I am	0
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from	1
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.	1
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.	1
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.	0
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.	0
Fine!	4
I'll do it without you!	4
I don't need you or anybody else!	4
I'm gonna make it on my own!	4
You'll see!!	4
You'll	0
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.	3
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.	2
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.	3
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.	0
And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.	0
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.	3
But you didn't!	1
I'm still alive!!	1
Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.	1
It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day!	1
I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!	1
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you!	4
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!	1
We'll do a quick check.	0
Okay.	0
So, eight days late huh?	2
Yeah.	0
You must be a little uncomfortable.	0
Eh, just a tad.	0
You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way.	0
It still could last a little while longer.	0
If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.	0
Do them!!	4
Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.	0
Well, we are ready to try anything.	0
Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.	0
Okay.	0
What is wrong with Emma?	3
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.	0
Anytime you're ready.	0
Ok, ok, here we go.	0
Ok, where am I talking to, here?	0
I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...	0
Just aim for the bump.	0
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.	0
You know, I, you know, can't do this.	5
I feel stupid.	3
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.	0
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.	1
Oh, hi. It's Mark.	0
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?	5
Okay, I do.	0
Okay.	0
I really do.	0
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.	0
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?	3
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.	2
Okay.	0
Okay?	0
Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!	2
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?	5
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...	0
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!	5
Oh, I can't watch this.	5
Check it out, he's winning!  Pete's winning!	2
Really?!	2
No-o-o!!	5
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.	5
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?	2
Well, this is ironic.	2
Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.	0
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!	4
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?	0
We could, or we can have sex in it.	1
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!	1
I thought I was a complete idiot.	2
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.	0
I said no.	0
What?!	2
What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.	2
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?	4
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.	0
Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?	5
Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great	3
Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet 'em all!	1
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.	0
That's okay.	0
She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so	0
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!	4
You tell them to wait!	4
Okay. Wait! Wait!	0
Emily.	0
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!	4
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?	0
Okay.	0
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.	3
Nevermind!	4
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.	0
Jen.	0
Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or	0
Sure! That would be nice.	1
Umm?	0
Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.	1
I will give you a call.	0
I'll see you later.	0
Okay!	1
I forgot my paper.	0
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.	0
What?	0
Okay.	0
Ow!	2
Aren't you gonna go?	0
No. Thank you.	0
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.	0
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.'  Well, if everybody's going.	0
No, y'know what don't close it  'cause the... keys...are in there.	0
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!	5
What's going on?	0
My lighter's in there!	5
I promise.	0
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.	0
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?	0
No, no he's not.	0
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.	2
What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?	2
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.	0
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.	0
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.	5
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe	0
Hey, what are you doing here?	0
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of	0
Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.	0
Where's Ben?	0
He's sleeping.	0
Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?	2
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.	1
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?	2
It's not that kind of anniversary.	0
Ah!  Oh.	2
Sooo!! Anyway...	0
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?	0
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!	1
Because he'll know what to do?  Oh my God, you're a genius!	1
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.	5
Give it. Give it.	0
Okay.	0
Oh!!	2
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.	3
Please. This is so your fault.	4
How, how is this my fault?	2
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.	4
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.	4
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!	4
Get in here.	4
Come on.	0
My god, you guys, I don't believe you.	4
There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.	4
So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!	4
Yeah, Susan.	0
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.	4
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?	0
"Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, ""Son of a bitch?"""	2
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!	2
Son of a bitch!	4
Okay, maybe ask this guy.	0
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.	0
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?	1
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is	0
The	0
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big	0
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?	0
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!	4
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?	0
Sure, I love this part!	1
Come on in.	0
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.	1
In the moment, yeah.	0
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?	1
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?	0
No.	0
Me neither.	0
3, 2,	0
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.	1
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.	1
Alright. Phoebe?	0
Okay, okay.	0
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!	1
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?	0
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.	0
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.	0
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?	0
Probably kill myself!	3
..Excuse me?	2
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!	3
Joey, uh-	2
You	0
I'm sorry.	3
Joey, onstage!	4
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?	3
I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.	3
Where are you Vic?	0
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.	3
Vic! Vic!	4
In a minute!!	4
So this is it? Victor?	3
Yeah, I guess it is.	3
Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me.	3
One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you.	3
But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I.	3
And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship,  and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.	3
But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone.	3
But I won't have aged at all.	0
So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.	0
So long, Vic!	3
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is	0
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on	0
What song was that, Pheebs?	0
Hi Monica!	1
Hey Mon!	1
Hey Mon!	1
Oh my God, has she slept at all?	2
Nope.	0
No, it's been three nights in a row.	0
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.	0
Oh, okay that explains it.	0
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum.	0
But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.	1
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?	0
Yeah, I know but	0
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.	0
Hey!	2
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?	1
You made pancakes?	2
Yep! Grab a plate.	1
No-no, stay right there.  Gettin' closer.	0
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,	0
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.	0
Oh yeah!	1
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.	0
Yeah, hero sandwiches.	0
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.	0
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.	0
Not you Joey.	0
Oh my good God.	2
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.	0
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.	4
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.	1
Oh, the mixed tape.	0
The Way You Look Tonight	1
You are just the sweetest.	1
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.	0
What?	0
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.	0
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.	1
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find	0
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!	1
Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someone's been doing their homework.	2
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so	0
Oh, I know.  Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda	0
Oh, me too.	0
and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!	1
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.	0
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?	4
It was really fun being married to you tonight.	1
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.	1
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?	3
Yeah.	0
That proposal, at the planetarium	0
I know, I know it was stupid.	3
Are you kidding?!	2
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!	1
It was...really wonderful!	1
Did you just make that up?	2
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out.	0
It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.	0
Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.	0
It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night	0
Goodnight	0
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?	0
I will think about it.	0
That's all I'm askin'	0
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!	2
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.	1
No it isn't, I ate that.	0
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.	0
Nope, got it and I got yours  too.	0
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.	1
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.	0
Ohh! That's great!	1
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the	0
Really?!	2
No-ho-ho!	1
Yeah.	0
I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job.	0
Although, I might need some convincing.	0
Well, I, umm	5
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!	1
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!	2
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.	0
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.	0
I think it means he freaked out and left!	2
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!	4
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?	3
Look... Okay, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back!	0
Okay?	0
You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?	0
I will, I will find him.	0
Hey!	1
Hi! Hey!	1
Do you guys know any cute guys?	0
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.	1
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.	1
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go	0
What's the charity?	0
I don't know, something either trees or disease... Ralph mumbles a lot.	0
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?	0
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.	2
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?	0
Hey!	1
What are you guys doing later?	0
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.	0
We do?	2
I want to see what he wants first.	0
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.	3
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!	2
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me.	5
It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.	3
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!	1
Thanks!	1
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.	0
Oh, hi! How are you doing?	1
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.	3
Thanks for having me over, you guys.	0
Tag?	0
Y-You're going?	1
Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk.	0
Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?	0
Colorado.	0
Ah, what good are you.	0
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.	0
Okay.	0
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said.	3
It... y'know what?	0
It just doesn't matter how I feel.	3
I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay?	3
Um, I'm not.	0
Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.	3
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.	3
Really?	2
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.	3
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!	4
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.	0
Pass it! Pass it!	1

No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!  What?!	4
Thank you.	0
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.	4
Your other student, was you!	4
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!	4
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!	4
Right here!	4
Here!	4
Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and	0
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play	4
"""Baddest man in the whole damn town."""	0
Oh, fine! Take his side!	4
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on!	4
Hey!	4
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!  Ahh!	4
Hi!	1
Hi.	0
Hi.  Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.	1
I think we do. Why don't we go inside?  Look uh, I know why you're here.	3
You do?	2
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.	0
Okay.	0
Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?	0
What?	2
I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and...and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?	3
Seriously. What?!	2
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
Y'know what?	0
If you want to, we can do it one more time.	0
I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that.	0
In fact, I have some time right now.	0
Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?	1
Oh sure.	0
I'm pregnant.  Ross?  Ross?  Okay, whenever you're ready.  And you're the father by the way... but you got that	4
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.	0
I know!	1
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.	2
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.	1
Hmph.	0
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her.	1
And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....	1
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!	1
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head.	4
And your like 'Mom, get outta here!'	4
You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing.	4
So it's kinda like, you're, you know.	0
You know.... You don't know!	2
You said...	0
I said '	0
Oh!	2
Look at Emma!	2
I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?	0
Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.	1
I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?	0
No, I know.	0
I know, because you're not in that place.	0
Which would be fine, except you totally are.	0
It's...it's complicated okay?	3
Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.	0
Look, we've been together.	3
Okay?	0
And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.	3
It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma.	3
I mean she-she thinking everything...  Oh that's...now me.	3
What do they put something in the water in this place?	0
Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.	3
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.	0
Yeah, exactly.	0
Right.  Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.	0
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have	1
You don't have a	0
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax	0
What-what are you doing?! Are you... Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!	4
I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around.	1
Uh-oh.	5
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.	0
Really? You think so?	5
I was talking to myself! You're going down!	4
Hey honey! I missed you today!	1
Oh, yeah?	2
Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?	0
Oh, well... Maybe we could...	0
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess?	1
Know your audience!	1
Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank.	0
We really need to take those tests?	3
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year.	0
I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.	0
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!	3
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?	0
No. Have you seen David?	0
No, no, he hasn't been around.	0
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.	0
Minsk?	2
Minsk. It's in Russia.	0
I know where Minsk is.	0
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.	1
So when, when do you leave?	0

You wanted to see me Professor Geller?	1
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.	0
Oo-oo!	1
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.	1
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our	4
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him.	0
Yeah, he doesn't like me.	4
He had C.H.E.E.S.E.	0
knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one!	4
Ohh!	2
Well, why don't you just get him fired?	0
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star!	4
Y'know?	0
There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.	0
Excuse me.	0
Joey Tribbiani.	0
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!	1
Wow!	2
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T.	0
The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.	0
It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.	0
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!	4
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!	4
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?	2
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.	1
What?	2
Look, we've always talked about having babies someday.	0
I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it.	0
We're good.	0
We're really good.	1
Oh, did you catch him?!	2
Wh-what did he say?!	2
"He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda.""  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?"	0
Why?! Why not?!	2
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!	3
He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!	3
What did you say to him?	0
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.	0
Oh yeah, sure.	0
Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.	1
And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.	0
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?	0
Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!	1
Oh, you came on to Ross!	2
What?!	2
Now I'm so happy.	1
What are you talking about?!	2
You used the Europe story!	1
That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!	4
How do you know about that story?!	2
How do	0
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!	0
Some guy!!	2
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.	0
Ken Adams!!	2
How we doing, you guys ready?	0
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?	0
Some days it's all I can think about.	0
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.	0
Oh... ok, fine.	0
But... ehm...	0
I just have one question for you,    ehm...	0
When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll...	0
Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok,    let's go!!	1
I can't believe this! How long as this been going on?	2
Well umm, Alexandra has been	0
Oh, it has a name?	2
Phoebe, don't get upset!	3
Okay... Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!	4
Well, Phoebe I thought I'd... ... Yeah, what the hell.	0
Ben!	5
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.	4
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!	5
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?	0
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring.	0
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.	3
Sorry.	3
Sorry!	3
I got my s's back!	1
Which we can celebrate later.	0
Celebrate.	0
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.	1
Rachel, how did this happen?	0
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.	5
Where?	0
At his apartment. Is this juice?	0
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?	4
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.	3
I licked my arm, what?	2
It's breast milk.	0
So?	0
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.	0
What is the big deal?	4
What did you just do?	2
You won't even taste it?	0
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?	0
Aww!	2
Oh sure!  Noo!	1
Ohh!!	2
My apothecary table!!!	2
What?!	2
Noooooo!!	5
Ross, where did you get this?!	2
Oh my God, Phoebe,	4
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!	4
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.	4
How is she?	3
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.	0
How's the hair?	0
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good.	3
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.	0
Can we see her?	0
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.	3
How're you doing?	3
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.	0
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.	1
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.	0
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...	0
Cantaloupe juice.	1
Exactly.	0
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.	2
Uh huh.	0
Oh, you've tasted it.	4
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.	0
Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.	4
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.	4
Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.	0
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.	4
Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.	0
Regina Philange.	0
I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.	2
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.	4
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!	2
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!	4
Well maybe it was all of your questions.	0
What about my questions?	0
No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.	0
Oh, I'll get it.	0
Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.	2
Relax, it's not like we're forking.	1
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!	1
Hey!	1
Hello.	0
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.	1
I know!!!	1
So, I'm here, ready to play.	1
Okay.	0
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.	1
What's this?	2
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.	1
Not one that can pee on the roof.	2
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.	1
And is this in case the house sneezes?	2
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.	0
I don't want a ghost.	5
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.	0
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.	2
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.	0
Hey!	2
Hello.	0
I need to talk to you!	1
Sure, what's up?	0
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.	4
Well, if you don't, I will.	4
Would you please go?	1
I would!	4
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!	1
Uh-huh.	0
Watch, watch.	1
Ooohhhh!!	2
And, and!	1
Ahhhh!!	2
Hey, my Father's house does that!	2
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.	0
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.	0
Okay. It's Emma.	0
Emma!  See? I don't want it.	3
Take it.	0
What?	0
It's clearly an Emma.	0
Oh honey, but you love that name.	3
Yeah, but I love you more.	1
Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing.	0
So I'm screwed.	1
"Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack, quack!"" I'm happy all the time!"	1
Nice try.	3
Wait, wait, wait!	1
Look, Monica	0
Look!	2
This is not going to work.	4
I bet this will work!	1
You are so great! I love you!	1
What?	2
"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"	5
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!	2
No I didn't!	5
Yes, you did!	2
No I didn't!	5
You love me!	1
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!	4
Hello Greg?	0
Hi, this is Monica from the plane?	0
Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5...   That is their old number!	4
Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!	4
Jenny! That is so Jenny!	1

Say next Saturday?	0
Okay, how about Sunday?	0

The week after that?	1
Y'know what Greg?	4
We are good, interesting, funny people with	4
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?	0
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.	0
What's a Movement class?	0
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.	0
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!	1
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.	0
I am.	0
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.	0
You really think so?	2
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!	2
Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the	2
Oh, okay, I'm having another one!	5
This one doesn't hurt either... Ooh, yes it does!	2
Ow!	4
Ow!	4
Ow!	4
Ow!	4
Ooh!	2
Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.	3
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?	0
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi!	1
Hi!	1
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!	5
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.	0
Yeah.	0
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.	0
But sadly I could not be enticed.	1
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.	3
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not.	4
Eh?	0
All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.	0
I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.	0
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.	0
Yeah.	0
Well, what period is it from?	0
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?	0
Yes, yes I do.	0
God, oh it's just perfect!	1
I bet it has a great story behind it too.	1
Did they tell you anything?	0
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.	1
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.	1
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?	4
Huh?	0
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.	0
I, umm, shut up!	4
Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.' You just wrote this!	3
Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?	0
Noooo!!	3
All right, hang on!	0
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.	0
But I	3
No-no, wait!	0
Just let me finish, okay?	3
This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want.	0
And it	0
It is? Really?	2
Yeah, sweetie.	0
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?	3
No.	3
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!	3
I'm gonna miss you!	3
I mean it's the end of an era!	3
I know!	3
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?	2
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'	4
Y'know what?	0
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.	0
Push!	1
Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder.	1
Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!	1
Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.	1
Let's...   I was just... yeah, right.	1
Push!	1
Push!	1
Okay.	0
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?	0
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.	3
Okay, go left. Left! Left!	2
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!	4
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!	4
Straight up over your head!	4
You can do it!	1
You can do it!	1
Okay.	0
You got it?	0
Oh, okay, I get it.	0
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even	5
Howard's the	0
Yes but too me he's just, man.	0
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.	4
Yeah. I really like his glasses.	0
Ohh!	2
What?	0
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!	2
Oh my God!	2
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.	0
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!	5
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time!	4
They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.	0
You're coming on to the entire room!  I'm Chandler.	4
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
You mind if I	0
No, please.	0
So uh, what are you in for?	0
I talk in my sleep.	0
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.	0
So why don't you give me your number?	0
Previously on Friends.	0
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.	0
Oh?!	2
Yeah, but without the costumes.	0
Oh.	0
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.	0
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are: 'They're	0
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?	2
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.	0
What's fish hooking?	2
Huh, what's fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?	0
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.	0
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.	3
Well, that makes me feel so good.	1
It was just so awkward and bumpy.	0
Bumpy?	2
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.	0
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.	0
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?	1
Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!	5
Oh well, it's not so bad.	0
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.	3
Oh!	2
My God!	2
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?	0
Excuse me?	2
Joey! He's working!  You would look	4
Oh, how bad is it?	3
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do	3
How's your room Rach?	0
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.	3
Isn't that mine?	0
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!	4
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?	0
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am	1
Yes, they can stay with us.	0
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?	0
There's just so much pressure.	4
I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.	0
I don't know if you'd understand.	0
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.	0
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!	3
I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time.	5
So I'm gonna go through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.	0
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because they frown on that.	0
Okay.	0
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!	4
Ross, we can handle this.	0
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.	3
I mean, enough of the silliness!	4
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!	4
Okay-okay!	4
Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together.	3
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?	3
That is so silly.	1
Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?	0
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.	0
Love is the best medicine.	1
That's laughter.	1
Why do you do it?	0
I don't know.	0
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?	0
Yeah, I do.	0
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?	0
Yes.	0
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!	1
Oh.	0
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.	0
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.	0
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!	2
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.	0
Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!	4
Define me!	4
Love me, I need love!	4
Have you really done this before?	2
Yeah!	1
Yeah!	1
Yeah!	1
You just take a big, big swing.	0
Now, don't hold back.	0
Hey!	1
Hey-hey-hey!	1
What are you doing?	0
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.	1
Oh, all right.	0
Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.	1
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.	1
Okay!	1
Bye!	0
Bye!	0
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!	4
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?	0
Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey.	0
Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.	0
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.	0
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!	2
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.	0
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?	0
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag... Why is nobody writing these down?	0
Because we can remember them.	0
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?	4
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played	0
I was always Joanne.	0
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?	0
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.	1
What a wank!	4
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.	4
I know!	4
And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.	4
And I'm appalled for you by the way.	4
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.	3
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.	4
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?	0
I'm, I'm freaking out!	5
Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have!	5
All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.	0
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?	0
Um. yeah.	0
I am	0
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.	0
So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.	0
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.	4
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.	0
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me!	4
Like me tiny doctor!'	4
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?	3
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.	4
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.	4
Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!	4
Okay, okay, okay.  I'll get the bagels.	0
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?	0
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.	0
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.	0
Really? A purse?	2
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.	4
It looks like a women's purse.	0
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,	0
See look,	0
Exactly! Unisex!	0
Maybe you need sex.	0
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.	1
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.	0
So, um, have you told your parents?	0
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .	0
Here you go.	0
You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.	0
no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.	3
I love you Phoebe.	1
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.	2
Hey!	1
Hi.	0
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?	0
Yeah, it did.	1
So, I guess this is over.	3
What?	0
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.	3
Why, exactly?	2
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.	3
Chandler that's crazy!	2
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than... Ohhh!	4
So, this isn't over?	0
You are so cute!	1
No.	1
No, it was a fight.	0
You deal with it and move on!	1
It's nothing to freak out about.	0
Really? Okay. Great!	1
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!	1
We're in a relationship?	2
I'm afraid so.	0
Okay.	0
Hi!	1
So you like the short hair better.	0
What? Yeti... I mean Danny?	0
Can I tell you a little secret?	0
Yeah!	1
I want to keep one.	0
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!	1
What? Honey.	0
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.	0
Oh God, I'm so sorry.	3
I know.	0
Ow!!	4
Oh God!	2
Hey, you guys! Guess what?	1
Got a job on a river boat?	0
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...	4
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.	0
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.	4
You like it right?	0
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!	0
Yeah, come here!	0
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?	0
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!	0
Okay, good bye!	4
Hey I got one! I got one!	1
Hi!	1
Hi.	0
Oh uh, up or down?	0
Oh down please.  I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?	1
Could you press up too please?	0
Sure! I feel so bad for you. I broke my leg once too.	3
Oh yeah? How'd yours happen?	0
Well, it's a long story.	0
It's kind of embarrassing.	0
Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.	1
How about you?	0
Car accident.	3
Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?	0
Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, that's me.  Hey uh, I take it you're just visiting someone.	0
Uh-huh, yeah.	0
Well umm, if you have sometime y'know and maybe you might want to visit someone else	0
Oh yeah! I-I would like that.	1
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!	4
Uh, you gotta press the button.	0
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.	0
Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.	2
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.	0
Oh my god.	2
What?	2
There's something new in the bowl.	2
Look, we have enough, just walk away.	5
No, but I want...I want the pinecones!	1
There's a forest right outside.	0
It's not the same.	0
Ok, go quick!	5
Thank you for a delightful stay.	1
Oh, my maple candy!	1
Oh my God, what happened?	2
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!	1
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.	1
Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.	1
Ross's what?	2
Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?	0
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.	2
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria!  I can make sangria!	1
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.	0
Oh.	0
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?	0
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.	3
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.	0
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.	0
Oh, what? What was it?	2
The three losers.	3
Oh, poor Lily.	3
Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.	3
Yeah, no, it was great.	1
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!	3
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!	4
Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.	0
Ok.	0
It worked!	2
Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.	3
Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won't stop crying.	3
Umm, she Rach, not it, she.	0
Yeah, I'm not so sure.	0
Oh my god, I am losing my mind.	4
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!	4
Well, you're not.	0
Yeah I can!  And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!	1
Monica. You've, you've done it right?	2
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?	4
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!	2
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities.	4
I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.	0
I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right?	0
He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.	0
Y'know, give him my flower.	0
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited	2
Y'know what? You are right?!	2
I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!	4
There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions!	4
Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever	0
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!	4
Oh what do you know? Virgin!	4
Push, push!	0
We're here!	1
Where have you been?	0
Long story, honey.	0
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need...  Excuse me, could I have this?	0
C'mon up.	0
Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.	4
So, I hear, you hate me!	4
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.	0
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.	4
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...	5
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.	4
So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.	0
But what does that gonna do...	4
For Chandler!	4
Guess what, I got an audition!	1
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.	1
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?	0
You bet! What's the part?	1
Oh it's great, it's a role on	1
Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?	0
I thought he was with you.	0
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.	0
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.	0
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.	0
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.	0
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.	1
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.	0
Honey, it isn't good luck.	0
Oh my God! Monica!	2
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?	0
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.	0
Yeah baby!	1
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.	0
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?	0
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!	4
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.	4
Who, Josh?	2
It's Joshua.	4
What, he doesn't like Josh?	2
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.	0
Oh no!	2
Wait!	2
Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right.	3
We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why?	3
Because we're girls.	0
Thank you, thanks.	1
Yeah, I lost it.	3
Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?	0
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.	2
Yeah, like I could	0
What?	2
I played bad on purpose guys.	1
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.	2
Yeah... no, just that last song.	0
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.	0
Oh yeah, who's playing?	0
The players.	0
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.	0
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.	0
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!	0
Oh.	0
Whose is it?	0
I don't want to say.	0
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?	1
Diane Keaton.	0
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go!  Come on!  Why aren't you dressed yet?!	4
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.	0
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.	0
Really?!	2
Oh that's so exciting!	1
Thanks Mon!	1
Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.	4
Fair enough, now go get ready!	0
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my...  I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.	0
My best shoes, so good to me.	1
I wear them everyday.	1
Down at the heel, holes in the toes.	1
Don't care what people say.	1
My feet's best friends, pals to the end.	1
With them I'm one hot chicky.	1
Though late one night, not much light, I....	0
I stepped in something icky.	1
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.	1
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here.	3
No more Joey and Chan's.	3
No more J and C's.	3
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?"""	0
"""Can't, its not there."""	0
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.	0
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.	3
Not once did we do that.	0
Hi.	0
Hey!	0
Hi.	0
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.	0
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?	0
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.	0
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator	0
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?	0
Yeah, okay, give that a try!	0
All right! Let's do it!	1
Woo-hoo!!	1
Yeah, cheerie-o!	1
London baby!	1
Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Monica? What time is it?	0
Uhh, 9.	0
But it's dark out.	0
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.	0
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.	0
I'm	0
I know, me too.	0
Hey!	1
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?	0
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.	1
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.	2
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.	0
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!	1
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.	0
Wait! What about Joey?	0
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?	0
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.	0
I'm so sorry!	5
You didn't bring	0
Hey!	1
Hi!	1
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.	0
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.	0
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.	0
Oh, you're switching apartments?	2
It's not for me, it's for Rachel.	0
But Rachel has an apartment.	0
Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.	0
She is?	2
Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?	2
I guess I didn't really think about it.	0
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!	4
Damnit!	4
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?	2
Little village people.	0
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.	1
Oh, that is so sweet!	1
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!	1
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.	0
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.	3
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!	3
Wait a minute!	2
Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant.	1
Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.	0
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!	1
Oh, she's gonna love that!	1
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?	0
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.	0
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.	0
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.	4
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.	0
What?!	2
Uh yes, heroin and crack.	0
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!	4
Well, you would know.	0
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?	0
Oh, come on!	3
Ross, please, I found the magazines!	3
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.	0
I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.	0
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?	1
I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!	3
Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it's-it's-it's, it's right there .	0
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.	1
Do you really?	0
No, I don't see it!	4
Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?	1
Yeah.	0
Sweetie that's it.	1
That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.	1
You're welcome.	0
Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.	2
Yeah, that's our baby.	1
Gin.	0

Will you stop!	1
Okay. All right.	0
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you.	1
Hey!	1

Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!	1
So you uh, want to do something tonight?	0
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.	0
Oh.	0
Oh right!	2

Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy.	3
I mean, I remember a time when	3
Are you okay?	0
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?	1
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was	1
I bet he can.	0
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you're okay?	0
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!	3
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.	0
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.	0
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.	4
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?	5
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.	0
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks.	1
I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.	2
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...	3
What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?	4
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """	4
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!	2
Like you, I don't even know where you work?	2
Yeah.	0
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a	4
Hey.	0
Hey!	0

Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.	4
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?	4
Yeah!	4
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .	0
Okay .	0
Here you go.	0
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.	0
Well, if you want, you can work here.	0
Uh, I don't know.	0
Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know?	0
And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.	3
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.	0
What?!	2
Flexible hours.	0
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?	0
I have no name.	0
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?	0
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.	0
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?	2
Umm, Gene.	0

You don't know anything.	4
Ohh, I know one thing!	1
What?	1
They did it right there on the couch.	0
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.	4
I mean, that guy with the toe thing?	4
Who's he sleeping with?	0
Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...	0
I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.	0
Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!	1
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.	0
So where did you study?	0
Oh, I didn't go to college.	0
No, where did you study acting?	0
Molly ... people don't study acting ...	0
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?	0
Sure, I'll go check on Emma.	0
Thanx.	0
Will the stable boy never get the princess??	3
You know, this isn't fair.	4
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?	4
Huh?	4
Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?	4
Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?	3
I didn't think I could ever love again.	3
Come on! Joe!	1
Hi, is Molly here?	0
Yeah, come on in. Molly?	0

It's my turn!	4
It's only fair!	4

Okay, well then bring her in.	0
OH....MY....GAWD!!!	2
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one... Dude! They're all huge!	5
They don't look any bigger than me!	0
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.	4
I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?	0
All right.	0
Okay.	0
Hi.	0
Whoa!  I kinda liked it.	1
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross.  Y'know, Red Ross!	4

Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for	4
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.	1
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.	0
We just want you to think it through.	0
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?	0
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.	0
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.	0
Thank you. All right.	0
Come, sit.	0

Sit!	4
Umm, all righty, before we get started I just... I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.	0
Lucky sixes....	0
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.	0
Hi!	0
And Joey....	0
Hi!	0
And Ross.	0
Hi!	0
He doesn't speak much English.	0
Look at that!	2
So, um... where did Paolo come from?	0
Oh... Italy, I think.	0
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.	0
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!	0
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.	0
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.	0
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.	0
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.	1
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.	0
You betcha!	1
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!	2
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.	0
That cup is mine!	4
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!	4
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?	3
Why?	3
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.	0
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.	0
I know I do.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
Guess what?	0
They published my paper.	1
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.	1
Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is.	1
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.	0
Oh.	0
What?! You got us evicted!!	4
I told you not to go down there!	4
Rachel always cries!	4
That's not true!	4
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!	0
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.	0
Go!!	4
All right, all right, all right.	0
I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.	0
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?	1
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.	0
How ya feelin'?	0
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.	0
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.	0
Woooo hoooo!!!	1
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'	4
Why, what happened?	2
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister.  Well, that's not the worst part.	3
What is the worse part?	0
I can't remember which sister.	3
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!	4
What's wrong with you?	4
Nothing!	4
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since.	3
But um, I don't think it's anything serious.	0
This sounds like a hernia. You have to... you-you... Go to the doctor!	2
No way!	4
Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!	4
Damn you 15s!	4
It's a trifle.	0
It's got all of these layers.	0
First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.	0
[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something's wrong.]	0
then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!	0
I like it.	1
Are you kidding?	2
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?	0
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.	0
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!	1
Oh, oh! It's on again!	1
Shhhh!	4
Folks, has this ever happened to you.	0
You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.	0
Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!	4
And there is Kevin.	0
Can we please turn this off?	3

Go ahead.	0
This works with any milk carton.	0
Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.	2
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.	0
She is not...  She's gay. Oh my God. She is	4
Good day for married people huh?	2
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.	3
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.	3
Try telling my wife that.	3
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?	0
I can't wait to be with you!	1
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.	0
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.	0

See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!	1
You chipped in?!	2
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.	0
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!	2
Yeah, but they didn't ask me!	4
Y'know?	0
This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger.	1
That's always fun to be.	1
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!	4
No I'm not.	0

If anything I'm making you look better!	1
They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!	1
Oh hey, Pheebs!	1
Hey!	1

Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?	0
Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?	0

Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?	3
Oh, there's banana on it.	0
You said she was bald.	4
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.	0
How could you not tell me that she has hair?	2
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.	0
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!	4
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.	3
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got	4
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.	3
Why, does she have a bad personality?	0
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!	1
Hey!	1
Hey.	0
Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.	5
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?	2
I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.	4
Whoa, for like months?	2
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?	1
No!	2
Oooh, wrong answer.	0
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!	4
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!	5
Then don't break in!!	4
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.	4
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.	0
Well it's very unsettling.	3
Honey, I was wondering....	0
Hmm?	0
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?	1
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.	3
Hmm.	0
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.	1
You remember not having sex in high school, right?	3
Yeah.	3
Well honey, what about you?	0
What?	0
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?	0
No.	0
Come on you gotta have one!	2
I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.	4
Not at these prices.	4
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!	1
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.	1
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend...  Oh!	2
Oh my God!	2
Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.	1
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.	1
Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?	1
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.	4
That's OK.	0
Oh, are you sure?	2
Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.	4
We can't do that.	0
What? What can't you do?	2
She really said that?	2
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...	0
But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.	0
'Tonight' tonight?	2
Well, I think it's perfect.	1
Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...	0
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.	3
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.	1
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?	0
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.	0
Alright, well, be good, I love you.	1
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.	4
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.	3
Really stupid.	4
Really stupid.	3
And I don't even know how it happened.	3
I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.	3
Are we okay now?	5
Yeah. No. No...	4
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.	0
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.	0
You're kidding.	2
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""	0
Oh there it is.	0
That's not your regular dry cleaners.	0
What?!	2
A new grocery store.	0
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me?	4
When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.	4
Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.	0
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.	0
Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.	0
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like	1

Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?	0
I hope you don't think I'm crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?	1
A little.   Now you're talking.	0
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?	0
I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.	1
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?	1
She must've left.	0

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!	2
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I... look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!	0
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.	0
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!	1
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.	1
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.	0
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.	4
I was shrieking... like a Marine.	0
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.	0
She's not much of a phone person.	0
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?	0
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.	4
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.	0
Maybe you should.	4
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?	3
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.	0

Oh, it is.	0
It isn't.	0

Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?	5
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them	0
No. No-no. No. What would	4
Who? Me the attacker?	2
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you.	3
Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.	3
No-no... Really?!	2
Of course!	1
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh	3
Ohh, I'm sorry.	3
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.	0
What?! Anything! Anything!	1
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.	0
This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?	5
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?	2
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.	0
Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on	0
Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before... ... Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!	3
They're all Chandler.	0
Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!	2
I did.  But it came at a price.	0
But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.	5
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!	2
Sure!	1
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?	0
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!	1
And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!	1
Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.	0
Well, I like that idea.	1
Obviously!	1
I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know?	0
I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like	0
"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."""	1
So, that's it?	2
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.	0
Which is why	0
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?	4
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!	4
Are you mocking me?	4
No, I'm not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.	0
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!	1
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.	1
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but	0
Cat.	0
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.	1
I love you too.	1
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!	0
Why?	2
I don't know.	0
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!	1
That's	0
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has	0
But	0
Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.	0
Why not?!	4
Because I'm dumping him today.	0
What?! You said he was sweet!	2
He	0
Just don't pick up your phone.	0
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?	2
You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.	3
Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.	0
Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!	0
Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.	3
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.	0
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.	3
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?	3
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.	0
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.	0
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.	3

No! No! I wanna see you take-off.	0
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?	1
Hi!	1
Hey.	0

All right, bye!	4
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!	4
Sorry.	3
I'm sorry Joey.	3
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!	2
It's so secluded up here.	0
I know. I like it up here.	1
I feel like we're the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry.	1
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?	0
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I... would you... actually, would you go check on that?	5
Honey, we don't have any bears here.	0

A lesson in the importance of unagi.	0
Ohh,	0
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to	0
All right, so we weren't	0
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I... look, I just want you guys to be safe.	0
What are you doing?	0
I'm leaning. This is where I lean.	0
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.	0
Brenda a bee!	5
What?	2
Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!	4
You do?	0
I totally understand.  Can I	0
All right, let's do it!	1
No, no, no. What was that?	2
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.	0
Well, people!	3
People, people, people.	0
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.	0
Show 'em how it's done.	0
Count it off.	0
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?	0
Yeah, invite him?	0
Hey, did I do these neat enough?	0
Yeah, they're fine.	0
Yeah?	1
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?	2
Sure. Why not?	0
Really?	2
Yeah?	0
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.	3
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?	5
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you.	3
But it's absolutely your decision.	0
More tea?	0
Yeah sure.	0
Earl Grey?	0
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.	0
Hi.	0
Hey!	1

Oh, everything went great.	1
Good.	0
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.	0
Oh.	1
I don't see the baby. Where is it?	0
Oh no, I know I couldn't see it either at first, but it's right umm...  Ross, I lost it again.	1
Could you help me with something?	0
The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.	0
And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.	0
I think I know who you're talking about.	0
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?	1
I'm sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff	0
Uh, she's with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.	0
Dr. Drake who?	0
Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information. I'm a doctor.	0
A doctor at this hospital?	2
Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?	4
Hands.	0
Hands!	0
It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.	0
He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!	0
He's in room 816.	0
816, thank you!	1
Thank you.	0

Oh, you're welcome a million.	1
Okay, I'll see you in our room.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh my God.	2
I know.	0
Okay, I gotta go.	0
Whoa! What?! Why?!	2
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.	3
Here?! Now?!	2
Well, yeah.	0
I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.	5
What happened?	2
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.	3
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!	1
Stupid, useless Canadian money!	4
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.	0
Really?	2
Will you call him?	0
Yes!	1
I will!	1
Absolutely!	1
Oh my God! That is so good!	1
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.	0
Hey!	0
Hey!	0
What do you got there?	0
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?	0
What are you doing tonight?	0
Huh? Uh	0
Dude! Dude!	2
Oh!  Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?	0
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.	2
What?! Tonight?!	2
That's what Monica said.	0
After she gave me that big speech?!	2
She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?	4
I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!	4
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?	0
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.	2
What?!	2
It's yours!	0
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.	3
Me too.	0
Hi Jill!	1
Hey!	1
Hi .	0
Rachel.	0
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.	2
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!	1
Okay. So well I'll umm,  I'll have her home by midnight.	0
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!	4
I'm sorry, man.	3
Hey, y'know what you should do?	0
You should make something happen for yourself.	0
Y'know, like-like write a play.	0
Write a movie!	1
Huh?	0
I mean, what about those	0
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?	3
Wait a second, I could star in it!	1
Or that.	0
I can't write!	4
Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?	3
I can't do it.	3
I'll help you.	0
Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.	0
And plus, it'll give me something to do.	0
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?	0
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.	0
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.	0
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.	0
Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.	0
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good.	0
All right.	0
As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.	0
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.	0
I would really love it if I could do both.	0
All right, I...I have to ask.	3
What?	0
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?	5
What?!	2
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?	4
Yes, yes it is. It's uh...  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!	4
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?	1
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.	4
Frannie was the one who found your	0
That bitch!	4
Monica! What	2
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!	4
Hi Frannie, congratulations.	0
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!	4
Why?!	2
What... Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding?	4
What could I have possibly done?!	4
Stuart!	4
I believe you know my husband.	0
So it's really a question of	0
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?	0
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?	2
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.	0
Yeah?	2
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.	0
What's up?	0
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.	0
Man to uh, me.	0
Sure. Okay.	0
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!	2
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.	0
You mean scared.	0
No, I mean happy.	0
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.	1
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.	3
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?	2
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.	0
What?! Over a stupid room!	2
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!	1
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!	1
Shut-out!!	2
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!	2
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!	3
Yeah, get out!	4
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!	4
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?	4
Come on, wussies!	4
All right, ok, I gotta go.	0
I'm going,  and I'm gone.	0
One more game?	0
Oh yeah!	1
I'm sorry.	3
Ohhh. Don't go.	3
No, I-I-I gotta go.	3
No. No! No! No!	3
Honey, honey, people are looking.	3
I don't care!  I don't care!!	4
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.	3
You can't leave! I have your shoe!	3
Good-bye Chandler Bing.	3
Rachel has those in burgendy.	0
What?	0
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.	0
Um, can you roll your tongue?	0
Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.	0
What, wait, you mean like this?	0
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.	2
Your not doing it.	0
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....	0
Where there is no fear of commitment.	0
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?	0
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.	0
But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.	0
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!	5
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.	0
Right.	0
In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.	0
Amazingly, that makes sense.	1
You think?	0
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!	1
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.	5
Hey!  Hey!	1
Hi!	1
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.	1
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?	1
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.	0
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?	0
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!	2
I'm missin' picture time?!	1
Y'know she has a face Ross!	4
Okay. Okay, here's a good one of us.	1
Wow!	1
That is a good one!	1
Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.	1
Y'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.	0
Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?	0
Together? Like-like to people?	2
Yeah, y'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?	1
Okay.	1
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?	0
Uh sure, sure.	0
Bye guys.	0
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.	4
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?	4
Is this about Mark?	0
Oh my God.	2
Okay, it's not, it's not.	0
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.	3
Fine, you're right.	0
Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..	0
No. A break from us.	3
Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.	1
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.	1
Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.	0
Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.	0
Oh? Why not?	0
It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.	0
What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?	4
Well now-now you're just talking crazy.	1
So why can't the three of us go out together?	0
Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.	3
Good God Bing I...well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.	3
And the way she looked at me, pure lust.	1
Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?	4
Bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this.	0
Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.	1
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.	4
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.	0
It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.	0
: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!	4
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.	0
What are you doing?	0
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.	0
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.	0
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.	0
Did he call?	0
No. Sorry.	3
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?	3
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.	0
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?	4
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.	0
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?	2
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?	4
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.	4
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?	3
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion!	4
Is that too much to ask after six years?!	4
I mean what?	4
Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!	4
I mean do we not have as much fun?!	4
Don't I deserve a few tears?!!	3
I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!	3
Hey!	4
I did not cry my eyes out!!	4
Come on!	3
It's like the end of an era!	3
No more J-man and Channie's!	3
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!	4
Do I know why we're rushing?	0
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?	0
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.	0
Oh, I found it!	1
That's so great for you guys!	1
Good luck, with your girlfriend.	0
Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!	1
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.	0
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.	0
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?	0
Yes, you can, very much.	1
Ahhhh!!	2
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!	1
Do	0
Ah,	0
Do	0
Ah,	0
DO YOU?	4
Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.	3
Hey!	3
All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!	1
And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.	0
And what you said about Nana.	0
Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there.	3
And you know what?	0
I think she was.	0
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?	2
You forget how many great songs Heart had.	0
Yeah.	0
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.	0
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.	0
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.	0
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.	0
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.	0
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.	4
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.	0
I can't find garbage bags!	4
Oh, I think I saw some in here.	0
What is it?!	2
I can't believe we're living here!	3
You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really  proposing?	2
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.	4
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it  look like?!	2
I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of  it.	4
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.	3
Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don't want to hurt her.	3
Okay, look, just do it gently.	0
You're right.	0
You're right.	0
I-I'll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I'll be gentle.	0
I can do that.	0
I am a gentle person.	0
Oh, by the  way.	0
Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.	0
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.	3
Which	0
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?	0
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.	0
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?	0
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which	1
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here	1
You completely stole my answer!	4
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.	3
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!	4
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.	0
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.	0
Would ya care to venture one?	0
Would	0
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?	4
All right, let's move on.	0
Okay then.	0
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.	0
And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she?	0
Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.	0
You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.	0
Diverse.	0
Did anybody call for security?	0
You be cool.	0
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey?	0
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?	5
Way to be cool, man.	0
What's he talking about?	0
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!	4
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?	2
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!	4
Okay, who are you?	2
The Hardy boys?	4
Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right?	4
I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?	4
Marry me.	0
Oh my God! Joey!	2
Hell yeah! I'll marry you!	1
You can't marry him!	4
Hey lady, your day's over! It's my turn!	4
Phoebe!	2
Why?! Why can't she marry me?!	2
I can and I will!	4
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.	0
Oh my God.	2
Hey!	4
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!	4
It's Joey!	2
Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant?  Who's the father?	2
We don't know.	0
Ohh... I wonder if that dude.	0
There's a dude?	2
Yeah.	0
Who? Who is it?	2
Was that story over?	0
The guy left this.	0
Oh my God! I know who the father is	2
People have got to finish their stories!	4
Oh my God, you're back!	2
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!	2
Why do you want to see my hand?	0
No!	4
Me too!	1
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?	0
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!	1
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!	1
Three, Two, One!	0

No! Year! Happy No Year!	1
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!	1
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?	0

They are completely different... Okay!	4
Okay!	2

Oh, it's okay. I don't	0
No-no, it's not okay!	3
It's not!	3

You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!	3
Y'know I'm just gonna... I, I am gonna make this up to you!	1

Hey, what do you want to drink?	0

Umm, honey, look he just came over to....	0
Yeah! Got it!	4
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.	0
Ah, that's okay, thanks.	3

Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?	3
Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.	0
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.	0
Sure.	0
Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?	2

Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.	1
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?	0
Oh right, Coach Ruben.	0
Do you know what Pheebs?	0
When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.	5
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.	0
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense.	0
What do you mean?	2
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!	4
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!	4

Second date!	1

Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?	4
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?	0
You're so pretty.	1
Hi!	1
Hey, Phoebe.	0
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.	0
You talked to him. Are you crazy?	2

It's nine o'clock in the morning!	2
Can I help you?	0
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?	0
He's not here right now.	0
Oh, you're kidding me!	4
All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.	0
Okay?	0
I'm an actor. I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.	0
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.	0
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You're the other one right?	0
Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.	3
What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!	2
There's nothing sexual about this?	4
Oo God!	3
What are you looking at?!	4
I mean hi.	0
Oh my... This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again!	5
No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages!	3
No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!	0
Really?!	2
Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.	0
Are you sure?	2
Yes.	0
I guess.	0
Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?	1
Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.	0

Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?	2
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?	1
Really?!	2
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.	0
Sweet!	1
All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.	0
Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.	0
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?	0
I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby	3
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?	0
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.	0
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.	0
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!	1
Oh, what a fun office.	1
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.	0
So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?	0
Rachel? Do you smoke?	0
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.	0
What?	0
Peach pit.	0
Yes, Bunny?	0
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-	0
#NAME?	0
Actually, nectarines, but basically...	0
Could've been a peach.	0
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.	0
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.	1
All right!	1
Westminster Abbey!	1
Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen.	1
Hey!	1
Okay.	0
What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?	0
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.	0
Really? To what?	2
To Put the Camera Away!!!	4
Man,	0
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!	2
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.	0
That's a mailman! That's	2
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy!	0
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?	0
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.	3
What?	0
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?	3
Rachel?	0
Yeah.	0
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?	0
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?	1
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.	0
Eh, do you believe that?	2
Yeah?	0
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.	4
No, you said the baby creeps you out.	0
No, the little girl creeps me out.	4
You said the baby.	0
Why would the baby creep me out?	4
Why would the little girl creep you out?	4
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?	0
This is going in your book?	2
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!	1
What?! Excuse me!	2
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.	0
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.	0
Yes, I made it!	1
I'm on time!	1
Okay, why don't we all uh,  open our books to page 23.	0
Where...  Where you will see...a uh...a bunch of uh...red spots.	0
Okay,  umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I...	0
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?	4
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.	0
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?	0
What the? What	2
Miss? May I help you?	0
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?	5
But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.	0
So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	3
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?	0
Do you want me to be afraid of you?	0
Of course not.	0
I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.	1
I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.	1
Really?	2
Of course!	0
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.	1
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit	0
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is	4
Ooh, it's not a toy.	4
Well, I don't know what else to do.	3
I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!	4
So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!	4
'Cause I-I got nothing!	4
All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.	4
Okay then.	0
Here we go.	0
Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?	0
Ask again later.	0
Later is not good enough.	4
Ask again later.	0
What the hell!	4
This is broken!	4
It-it is broken!	4
All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.	0
Excuse me.	0
Yeah?	0
Are you Phoebe Buffay?	0
Yeah.	0
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.	1
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...	0
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.	1
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.	4
Come on, two on one.	0
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!	2
What, now?	2
Yes, now is when you swoop!	1
You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!	1
You're like, like the anti-Paolo!	4
My Catholic friend is right.	0
She's distraught.	0
You're there for her.	0
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!	1
Well, I just called Joshua	0
Oh, how did it go?	3
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married... I'm just going through a hard time.	0
What did he say?	0
Well uh, his answering machine was	3
Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.	3
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care.	3
I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.	3
Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.	3
Yeah, maybe.	3
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.	3
Any luck?	3
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?	3
I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.	3
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.	3
Hey!	1
I don't get it!	2
It was in my room all night!	4
And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you  didn't take it, then who did?	4
Shh!	4
We're trying to think!	4
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.	0
What?!	2
Oh yeah!	1
I got in there myself once.	0
My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.	0
Yeah.	0
It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.	0
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.	0
Oh yeah?  If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.	4
All right, you have yourself a deal.	0
Okay.  See?! I told ya!	2
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!	4
Hey! What's up?	0
Hey!	1
Hey-hey, who's your friend?  Hey!!	1
Hey Joey!	1
Erin! Still here!	1
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!	1
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.	1
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!	1
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.	4
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just	0
Really?!	2
Ohh!	2
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.	0
Really?!	2
Yeah!	1
I mean you definitely should do that.	0
Y'know what, I should do it.	1
Yeah!	1
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.	1
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!	0
All right.	0
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.	3
This woman's living my life.	4
What?	2
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!	4
Look at this, look.	4
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.	4
She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.	4
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.	4
You're not an artist.	0
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.	4
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.	2
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.	4
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.	0
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!	5
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!	2
How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!	2
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?	1
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.	0
I know. My arm is killing me.	0
No, I meant with the dropper over here.	0
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm	4
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.	3
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.	3
Hey.	0
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.	0
What's the matter?	0
Nothing.	0
What is it? Hey!	3
Really it's nothing. I'm just	3
Rach come on, what?	0
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.	3
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?	2
Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.	3
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?	0
I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?	3
Yeah, I guess so.	0
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?	3
Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!	2
I just found out this is Chandler's office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!	1
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.	4
We said seven!	4
We said six!	4
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.	0
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass... seven!"""	4
Hi!	1
I know what time you said.	1
What?!	2
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.	0
You, get out of my shop!	4
Well, what did he do?	2
He went out with my wife!	4
Joey!	2
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I... Hey! I did	4
That's my wife!!! Get out!	4
Well, we should go.	0
Yeah.	0
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.	0
Oh please.	0
Every moment is precious.	3
Y'know?	0
Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.	3
Well, we're really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.	0
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.	3
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.	4
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.	0
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.	0
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.	0
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.	0
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.	1
Yeah?	2
Yeah!	1
Just go for it Chandler.	0
Yeah, you should.	0
Yeah, you should, really.	0
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.	0
: I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.	3
Come on Treeger, don't say that.	3
You just ahh, you just need more practice.	0
Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again.	0
Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.	3
I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a...  We-he!!	1
Hey!	1
: Yeah!	1
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like	0
July. Umm,	0
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?	1
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.	0
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.	1
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.	0
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.	3
I-I do though.	3
I do too.	3
Bye Phoebe.	0
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.	3
Yeah, I-I heard.  I think it's great!  Ohh, I'm so happy for you!	1
I can't believe you're getting married!	1
Yeah.	0
Monica and Rachel made out.	0
Ohhh!	2
Why are we in bed together?	2
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?	0
Yeah.	0
Really?!	2
No!	0
But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we?	5
I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.	0
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.	1
And we didn't have sex.	0
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.	0
Tell me about it.	0
What are we gonna do?	0
I say we go with	0
Chandler?	0
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?	0
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?	3
I know!	4
Hi, remember us?	0
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a	0
I am. I'm	0
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.	0
Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.	3
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.	0
Y'know what? It	0
Sorry.	0
I'm so exited!	1
I've been waiting for this for months!	1
I got my hair coloured!	1
I got new sheets!	1
I'm making him a	1
What am I making him by the way?	0
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.	0
I thought I was making him filet mignon?	2
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.	0
And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.	4
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.	2
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!	3
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated.	5
Y'know it's like uh, Biology!	0
Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.	5
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.	0
Phoebe!	1
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.	0
You are falling fast asleep.	0
Deeper.	0
Deeper.	0
Deeper.	0
You are now completely asleep.	0
You don't need to smoke.	0
Cigarettes don't control you.	0
You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.	0
A strong, confident woman.	0
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.	0
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.	1
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?	0
Of course not.	3
No.	0
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.	0
So how are things going with Paul?	0
Good.	1
Although y'know, he-he's a private guy.	0
Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.	3
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.	0
So what are you saying.  I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?	2
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.	0
Hi honey.	0
Hi!	1
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.	5
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!	2
You said number two.	0
I also said number one.	0
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.	0
Can't I just look at the handles on them?	0
You would think.	0
Okay, fine.	0
Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?	4
Because, I don't care.	0
I don't care.	0
I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do.	4
So I don't think I should do it anymore.	3
I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.	3
What?!	2
Gunther, I quit.	3
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?	2
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!	1
I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.	0
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!	1
Do you uh, do you... ready for a refill?	0
Oh, I probably shouldn't... so I will!  Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!	2
Pretty cool, huh?	1
But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.	0
Umm, can I use your bathroom?	0
It's uh, right through there.	0
Okay.  God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment	1
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?	1
You know, I think I was sixteen.	0
Please, just a little bit off the back.	0
"I'm still on ""no."""	0
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?	0
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.	4
What's goin' on?	0
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.	0
What stupid thing did you do?	0
I know.	0
See, yes.	0
That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick.	0
I love you both.	0
But in very different ways.	0
Hey!	2
Hey!	2
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?	4
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!	4
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.	5
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.	1
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!	1
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?	0
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.	0
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?	0
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.	0
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.	0
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!	1
Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?	2
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?	0
Because I'm very happy for him!  And	1
Hi!	3
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?	4
Fish!	2
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.	0
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here	3
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.	1
We did have fun, didn't we?	1
We did!	1
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.	0
Oh, I would love to!	1
Yay, okay!	1
Good, good, good, good, good.	1
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.	0
Um...  Done!	0
Okay, it's coffee.	0
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!	2
It's-it's hot	0
Hot coffee!!!	2
You idiot!!	4
You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!	4
What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!	4
Huh?	4
What's your favourite thing about summertime?	0
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.	0
Yeah	0
Hey!	2
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?	1
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.	0
Ohh, that's a good one.	1
OK, try this salmon mousse.	0
Mmmm. Good.	1
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?	0
It's creamier.	0
Yeah, well, is that	0
My God! What happened to you?	2
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""	4
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!	1
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really	4
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!	3
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.	1
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.	0
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.	0
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!	3
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?	0
I don't see why not.	0
Here's my retainer!	0
Someone in there?	0
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'	4
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?	2
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.	0
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.	0
Ginger.	0
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....	0
Don't you have to use the bathroom?	0
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you.	0
Yes, I do.	0
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.	0
Someone in here.	0
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!	4
Oh yes there is!	4
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!	4
Oh, my baby!	3
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?	2
Oh, just years of experience.	0
Can I get some ice here?!	3
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.	1
You're not the fan who's dying are you?	0
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!	1
Oh that was a real person?!	2
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me	0
I-I-I'm leaving the show?	2
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?	0
Who told you that?	2
Oh uh, one of the writers.	3
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?	2
Feel better?	0
Yeah!	1
Much!	1
Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.	0
Yeah, I understand.	0
Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?	2
I don't think so.	0
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on	1
Wow!	2
Yeah.	0
Really?!	2
$4.50 please.	0
Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.	0
Alright, alright, alright.	0
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.	4
Oh God, do something.	4
Just make contact, smile!	4
There you go!	1
You're definitely scaring here.	0
Would you like to call somebody?	0
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.	0
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.	4
Oh	0
It's my sister.	0
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the	0
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?	4
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a	0
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.	0
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.	0
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.	3
Why, nobody good?	0
Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.	4
Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing	0
So how many more do you have tomorrow?	0
Two.	0
This photographer, who seemed really dull.	0
And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'	0
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!	0
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.	4
What?	0
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...	0
Umm, how's it going with you guys?	0
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.	0
Oh, really?	2
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference	1
Hey!	0
Hi!	0
What-what are-what are these?	2
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?	1
No-no-no, no!	5
Well, how-how come?	0
That's just the way it is.	0
That's crazy.	2
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.	0
See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter!	0
Hey, Peter!	0
It's me Rhonda!	0
From PS-129!	0
I shared my puddin' which you man!	4
I gave you my	0
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you.	0
Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he	0
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.	0
Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.	0
How's that coffee comin,' dear?	0
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.	0
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.	0
I know!	1
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?	2
Op.	0
Eh.	1
Oh, you got me.	0
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential.	0
Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion.	0
How does that sound?	0
Oh, that sounds great.	1
Come on over here, sweetheart.	0
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.	1
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?	5
No. But thanks.	0
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?	3
Okay. No. But thanks.	0
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.	0
Wow, that was kinda brutal.	2
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.	0
Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know.	0
Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,	0
Wow.	2
I'm, I'm really sorry.	0
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.	0
Relieved?	2
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.	0
Oh my God! If you say that one more time,	4
Fine!	4
Fine!	4
But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  'If you accept full responsibility...'  Full responsibility!	4
I can begin to trust you again.	4
Does that seem like something you can do.	4
Does it?!	4
No?	2
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel.	0
If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.	0
Yeah, I know.	3
I mean, no, you're right.	3
Yeah I guess I'll let it go.	0
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.	3
Sure, it's hard to forget!	0
But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it!	0
A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.	0
What the hell happened on that beach?!	2
It's between us and the sea, Ross!	0
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.	1
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.	0
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.	3
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.	0
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?	2
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.	0
Oh wow! I'm free for her!	1
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!	2
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?	0
Hold on, y'know I	0
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!	1
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.	0
Well, I don't really know what that is, but	0
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.	0
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.	0
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.	2
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.	0
Joey, get out of the fridge.	4
All right, all right.	4
What is that?	2
For the ride.	0
Yeah, like in a cab...	0
Save it.	0
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.	0
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.	1
All right, I'm going. I'm going.	4
Here we go, here we go.	0
Rossy, Rossy.	0
WHAT IS IT?!	4
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.	1
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.	0
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.	0
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.	1
Oh my God! Calling from Rome!	2
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.	0
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.	1
Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.	3
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.	1
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.	0
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.	0
You know it?	2
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?	0
Oh, sure, they love us over there.	0
Ben! Ben! Ben!	1
How about Joey... Pepponi?	0
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.	0
Joey... Switzerland?	0
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.	0
Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.	0
Which I'm not.	0
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?	0
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.	0
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...	0
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.	1
Might wanna try Joseph.	0
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!	1
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.	1
Are you kidding?	2
Okay, look.	0
I-I studied evolution.	1
Remember, evolution?	1
Monkey into man?	4
Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey.	0
I'm Doctor Monkey!	4
I'm not arguing with that.	0
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.	0
You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!	4
Now let it go!	4
The joke sucks!	4
It's your joke.	0
Is not.	4
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.	1
I didn't!	1
Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.	0
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.	1
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!	2
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and	0
Did you, did you	4
No.	0
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?	4
Yes!	1
Then don't touch one!!	4
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!	2
Yeah!	1
Thanks!	1
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.	0
Done!	1
And it can't be Joey.	0
It's not.	0
Or Joseph.	0
Oh.	0
Hi!	0
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.	1
Wow! Skates!	1
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?	2
Well...	0

So, keep having sex on a regular basis.	0
Oh, DAMN IT!	4
Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.	0
