Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.	3
What?	2
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.	0
You're a genius!	1
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!	3
Now, there's two reasons.	0
Hey.	0
Hey!	1
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.	0
Where?!	2
On the touchy.	0
And	0
No, I know!	2
I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.	4
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.	0
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get	1
Thank you, Joey.	0
No-no, thank you.	0
Hey Estelle, listen	0
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They	2
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!	2
Really?!	2
Yeah!	1
Oh well, no harm, no foul.	0
Okay, you guys free tonight?	0
Yeah!!	1
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.	2
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?	0
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.	0
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars.	2
What exactly were you looking for, hmm?	0
Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?	0
Uhh....	0
Ah... Ah...Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?	4
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far too progressionist.	0
I find Marion's views far too progressionist.	0
I'm sorry, who are you?	2
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.	0
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh... Wait!  Did you write this?	2
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!	2
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.	2
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.	0
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.	4
What?	2
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.	4
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?	4
The point is I...	4
I don't need this right now, OK.	4
It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy.	4
This ship has sailed.	4
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.	4
Fine.	4
Cause I don't need your stupid ship.	4
Good.	4
Good.	4
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.	1
Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.	0
All in good time my love.	0
All in good time.	0
Oh shoot!	2
I left my guitar in their apartment.	3
Well you can let me in later.	0
I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.	0
What?! They took mine to give to you!	2
Why would they take away our keys?	2
Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.	1
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.	1
A	0
No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.	0
Uh, what?	2
Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.	1
What... You're not serious.	2
I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her.	4
Hi Ross!	1
Hi roomie!	1
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?	0
I don't know!	0
It's not like it's porn!	0
This is a serious, legitimate movie.	0
And the nudity is really important to the story.	0
That's what you say about porn.	0
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.	0
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!	1
Well that's true.	0
And I am only naked in one scene.	0
Plus it sounds really great.	0
My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.	0
Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.	0
So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.	0
It's really sweet and-and tender.	1
Hey, what's up?	0
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.	3
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.	0
"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!"	1
Yeah?	0
I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know?	0
Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me.	0
And what's more different than me. A guy who's	0
So where are we going next?	0
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.	0
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?	5
Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?	1
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!	4
Yeah, no one talks like that!	4
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!	4
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!	4
How do you figure that?	0
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!	0
I guess so.	0
Here you go. Thank you!	0
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?	0
Oh what, you-you want both of them?	2
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!	4
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it.	5
I know it's in the apartment, but I	0
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!	5
Tell her to wear her own earrings.	4
These	0
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!	4
Why not?	0
Because I lose her stuff!	4
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?	0
Yeah!	0
What's going on?	0
Chandler's gone again!	2
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!	3
Okay. You ready to push again?	0
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.	4
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!	1
Yeah!!	1
Little Leslie is here!	1
We got another one!	2
Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children.	2
How scary is that?	2
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!	1
All right, he's coming. He's coming!	1
Hey, where's his thing?	2
Chandler's a girl!	2
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.	2
They musta read the sonogram wrong.	2
Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl!	2
Chandler's a girl!	2
Okay, keep saying it!	1
Am I too late?!	0
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.	1
We have our babies?	2
Yeah.	1
Oh, we have our babies.	1
Hey Toby!	1
Hey Bobby.	0
It's Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler	0
Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?	0
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.	4
Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.	3
Toby don't.	3
Bob!	3
Toby! I'm not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!	4
Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!	1
I know! I found it on the street.	1
Are you serious... Really?! It's in such good condition.	2
Yeah.	0
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?	2
I don't know.	0
It's moving.	5
It's still... ... It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!	5
Ooh! Ah! Okay!	5
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing	0
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So	3
Oh just say it Kyle!	2
We're gonna give it another try.	1
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!	4
I'm gonna work on that.	0
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.	4
Y'know, he hums when he pees!	4
I do know.	0
We're so sorry.	3
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.	4
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.	4
Yeah, we're gonna go.	0
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she	3
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.	0
Yeah, we're better off without them.	4
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!	4
Divorced men's club.	3
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?	4
Maybe because you've got the keys?	4
This is totally your fault!	4
My fault?! You threatened the judge!	4
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!	4
Phoebe!	0
Yeah?	0
Have you seen Chandler?!	0
No! Why?	0
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!	5
I know!	5
How bad is this?	5
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!	5
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!	5
What are you gonna do?	0
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure!	4
"""Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"""	0
Rachel said that!	2
Well Rachel's not here!	4
Come on, come on.	0
Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.	4
This is all your fault.	4
This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?	4
My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.	4
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.	4
No no no, believe me.	4
No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?	4
And you know what the funny thing is?	0
When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?	4
Where does that leave me?	3
You get to be the baby's father.	0
Everyone knows who you are.	0
Who am I?	4
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.	3
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.	0
This is so great.	1
You wanna explain that?	0
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.	3
And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.	1
And it's not even born yet.	3
It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.	1
I'm sorry, you were fighting.	3
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.	0
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?	0
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!	1
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can	0
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!	2
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.	0
I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...	0
You know he's gay?	0
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?	0
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.	0
Hi. Hi.	0
What are you doing here?	2
Well, what?	0
What?	0
What is it?	0
That she left you?	2
That she likes women?	0
That she left you for another woman that likes women?	0
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...	4
Then what?	0
My first time with Carol was...	0
What?	0
It was my	0
With Carol?  Oh.	2
So in your whole life, you've only been with one... ... oh.	2
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!	2
Hi. Where is everybody?	0
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?	3
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.	3
Oh no! Why?	2
Cause Carol's a lesbian.  And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.	3
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.	2
I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!	3
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?	0
Well, now I do!!	2
I'm sorry.	3
Seven years.	3
I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....	3
Aw, God Ross. Oh.	3
I'll do it.	0
No you won't.	0
Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry.	3
But,  you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.	0
Okay, absolutely!	1
All right.	0
You've got it.	0
Cookie, now you can punch him!	4
What?!	2
All right, that's it, I quit.	4
What? I didn't say anything.	2
Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.	4
Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.	4
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.	3
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.	4
Julie.	0
What?!	2
Jody!	2
You were with Julie?	0
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.	0
And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.	0
Oh. Oh my God.	2
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.	3
Yeah, right. Sure!	4
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.	3
Look, I'm sorry, all right.	3
I never meant for you to find out!	3
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.	4
That is not true!	4
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?	4
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?	4
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to	3
Yeah!	2
I can't say.	0
Why?!	2
Why not?	3
I can't say because he's famous.	0
Oh my God, who is it?!	2
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.	4
Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.	0
As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?	2
What?! Well he never said that to me!	2
In	0
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.	3
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.	1
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.	0
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.	0
Oh, let's not tell this story.	3
Oh, come on!	3
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!	1
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!	2
Hey, it's not like it sounds.	0
It's	0
Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!	4
Who was that?	0
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.	3
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.	3
Ten dollars an hour.	0
No.	0
Twelve dollars an hour.	0
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.	0
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.	4
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour.	4
Done.	1
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!	5
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!	5
No! I won't leave you!	5
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!	3
No you're not! Not to me!	4
Oh my God.	2
What?	0
I am	0
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from	1
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.	1
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.	1
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.	0
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.	0
Fine!	4
I'll do it without you!	4
I don't need you or anybody else!	4
I'm gonna make it on my own!	4
You'll see!!	4
You'll	0
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.	3
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.	2
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.	3
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.	0
And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.	0
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.	3
But you didn't!	1
I'm still alive!!	1
Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.	1
It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day!	1
I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!	1
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you!	4
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!	1
We'll do a quick check.	0
Okay.	0
So, eight days late huh?	2
Yeah.	0
You must be a little uncomfortable.	0
Eh, just a tad.	0
You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way.	0
It still could last a little while longer.	0
If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.	0
Do them!!	4
Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.	0
Well, we are ready to try anything.	0
Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.	0
Okay.	0
What is wrong with Emma?	3
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.	0
Anytime you're ready.	0
Ok, ok, here we go.	0
Ok, where am I talking to, here?	0
I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...	0
Just aim for the bump.	0
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.	0
You know, I, you know, can't do this.	5
I feel stupid.	3
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.	0
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.	1
Oh, hi. It's Mark.	0
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?	5
Okay, I do.	0
Okay.	0
I really do.	0
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.	0
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?	3
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.	2
Okay.	0
Okay?	0
Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!	2
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?	5
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...	0
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!	5
Oh, I can't watch this.	5
Check it out, he's winning!  Pete's winning!	2
Really?!	2
No-o-o!!	5
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.	5
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?	2
Well, this is ironic.	2
Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.	0
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!	4
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?	0
We could, or we can have sex in it.	1
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!	1
I thought I was a complete idiot.	2
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.	0
I said no.	0
What?!	2
What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.	2
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?	4
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.	0
Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?	5
Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great	3
Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet 'em all!	1
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.	0
That's okay.	0
She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so	0
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!	4
You tell them to wait!	4
Okay. Wait! Wait!	0
Emily.	0
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!	4
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?	0
Okay.	0
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.	3
Nevermind!	4
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.	0
Jen.	0
Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or	0
Sure! That would be nice.	1
Umm?	0
Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.	1
I will give you a call.	0
I'll see you later.	0
Okay!	1
I forgot my paper.	0
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.	0
What?	0
Okay.	0
Ow!	2
Aren't you gonna go?	0
No. Thank you.	0
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.	0
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.'  Well, if everybody's going.	0
No, y'know what don't close it  'cause the... keys...are in there.	0
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!	5
What's going on?	0
My lighter's in there!	5
I promise.	0
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.	0
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?	0
No, no he's not.	0
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.	2
What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?	2
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.	0
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.	0
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.	5
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe	0
Hey, what are you doing here?	0
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of	0
Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.	0
Where's Ben?	0
He's sleeping.	0
Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?	2
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.	1
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?	2
It's not that kind of anniversary.	0
Ah!  Oh.	2
Sooo!! Anyway...	0
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?	0
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!	1
Because he'll know what to do?  Oh my God, you're a genius!	1
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.	5
Give it. Give it.	0
Okay.	0
Oh!!	2
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.	3
Please. This is so your fault.	4
How, how is this my fault?	2
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.	4
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.	4
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!	4
Get in here.	4
Come on.	0
My god, you guys, I don't believe you.	4
There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.	4
So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!	4
Yeah, Susan.	0
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.	4
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?	0
"Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, ""Son of a bitch?"""	2
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!	2
Son of a bitch!	4
Okay, maybe ask this guy.	0
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.	0
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?	1
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is	0
The	0
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big	0
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?	0

No.	0
Me neither.	0
3, 2,	0
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.	1
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.	1
Alright. Phoebe?	0
Okay, okay.	0
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!	1
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?	0
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.	0
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.	0
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?	0
Probably kill myself!	3
..Excuse me?	2
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!	3
Joey, uh-	2
You	0
I'm sorry.	3
Joey, onstage!	4
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?	3
I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.	3
Where are you Vic?	0
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.	3
Vic! Vic!	4
In a minute!!	4
So this is it? Victor?	3
Yeah, I guess it is.	3
Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me.	3
One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you.	3
But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I.	3
And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship,  and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.	3
But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone.	3
But I won't have aged at all.	0
So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.	0
So long, Vic!	3
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is	0
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on	0
What song was that, Pheebs?	0
Hi Monica!	1
Hey Mon!	1
Hey Mon!	1
Oh my God, has she slept at all?	2
Nope.	0
No, it's been three nights in a row.	0
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.	0
Oh, okay that explains it.	0
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum.	0
But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.	1
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?	0
Yeah, I know but	0
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.	0
Hey!	2
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?	1
You made pancakes?	2
Yep! Grab a plate.	1
No-no, stay right there.  Gettin' closer.	0
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,	0
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.	0
Oh yeah!	1
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.	0
Yeah, hero sandwiches.	0
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.	0
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.	0
Not you Joey.	0
Oh my good God.	2
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.	0
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.	4
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.	1
Oh, the mixed tape.	0
The Way You Look Tonight	1
You are just the sweetest.	1
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.	0
What?	0
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.	0
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.	1
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find	0
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!	1
Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someone's been doing their homework.	2
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so	0
Oh, I know.  Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda	0
Oh, me too.	0
and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!	1
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.	0
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?	4
It was really fun being married to you tonight.	1
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.	1
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?	3
Yeah.	0
That proposal, at the planetarium	0
I know, I know it was stupid.	3
Are you kidding?!	2
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!	1
It was...really wonderful!	1
Did you just make that up?	2
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out.	0
It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.	0
Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.	0
It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night	0
Goodnight	0
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?	0
I will think about it.	0
That's all I'm askin'	0
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!	2
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.	1
No it isn't, I ate that.	0
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.	0
Nope, got it and I got yours  too.	0
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.	1
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.	0
Ohh! That's great!	1
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the	0
Really?!	2
No-ho-ho!	1
Yeah.	0
I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job.	0
Although, I might need some convincing.	0
Well, I, umm	5
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!	1
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!	2
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.	0
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.	0
I think it means he freaked out and left!	2
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!	4
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?	3
Look... Okay, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back!	0
Okay?	0
You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?	0
I will, I will find him.	0
Hey!	1
Hi! Hey!	1
Do you guys know any cute guys?	0
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.	1
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.	1
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go	0
What's the charity?	0
I don't know, something either trees or disease... Ralph mumbles a lot.	0
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?	0
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.	2
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?	0
Hey!	1
What are you guys doing later?	0
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.	0

Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!	2
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me.	5
It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.	3
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!	1
Thanks!	1
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.	0
Oh, hi! How are you doing?	1

Thanks for having me over, you guys.	0
Tag?	0

Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?	0
Colorado.	0
Ah, what good are you.	0
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.	0
Okay.	0
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said.	3
It... y'know what?	0
It just doesn't matter how I feel.	3
I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay?	3
Um, I'm not.	0
Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.	3
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.	3
Really?	2
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.	3
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!	4
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.	0

Thank you.	0
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.	4
Your other student, was you!	4

Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!	4
Right here!	4

Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and	0
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play	4
"""Baddest man in the whole damn town."""	0
Oh, fine! Take his side!	4
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on!	4
Hey!	4

Hi!	1
Hi.	0
Hi.  Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.	1
I think we do. Why don't we go inside?  Look uh, I know why you're here.	3
You do?	2
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.	0
Okay.	0
Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?	0
What?	2
I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and...and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?	3
Seriously. What?!	2
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
Y'know what?	0
If you want to, we can do it one more time.	0
I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that.	0
In fact, I have some time right now.	0
Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?	1
Oh sure.	0
I'm pregnant.  Ross?  Ross?  Okay, whenever you're ready.  And you're the father by the way... but you got that	4
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.	0
I know!	1
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.	2
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.	1
Hmph.	0
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her.	1
And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....	1
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!	1
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head.	4
And your like 'Mom, get outta here!'	4
You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing.	4
So it's kinda like, you're, you know.	0
You know.... You don't know!	2
You said...	0
I said '	0
Oh!	2
Look at Emma!	2
I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?	0
Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.	1
I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?	0
No, I know.	0
I know, because you're not in that place.	0
Which would be fine, except you totally are.	0
It's...it's complicated okay?	3
Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.	0
Look, we've been together.	3
Okay?	0
And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.	3
It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma.	3
I mean she-she thinking everything...  Oh that's...now me.	3
What do they put something in the water in this place?	0
Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.	3
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.	0
Yeah, exactly.	0
Right.  Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.	0
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have	1
You don't have a	0
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax	0
What-what are you doing?! Are you... Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!	4
I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around.	1
Uh-oh.	5
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.	0
Really? You think so?	5

Oh, yeah?	2

Oh, well... Maybe we could...	0
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess?	1
Know your audience!	1
Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank.	0
We really need to take those tests?	3
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year.	0
I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.	0
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!	3
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?	0
No. Have you seen David?	0
No, no, he hasn't been around.	0
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.	0
Minsk?	2
Minsk. It's in Russia.	0
I know where Minsk is.	0
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.	1
So when, when do you leave?	0

Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.	1
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our	4
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him.	0
Yeah, he doesn't like me.	4
He had C.H.E.E.S.E.	0
knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one!	4
Ohh!	2
Well, why don't you just get him fired?	0
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star!	4
Y'know?	0
There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.	0
Excuse me.	0
Joey Tribbiani.	0
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!	1
Wow!	2
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T.	0
The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.	0
It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.	0
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!	4
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!	4
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?	2
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.	1
What?	2
Look, we've always talked about having babies someday.	0
I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it.	0
We're good.	0
We're really good.	1
Oh, did you catch him?!	2
Wh-what did he say?!	2
"He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda.""  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?"	0
Why?! Why not?!	2
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!	3
He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!	3
What did you say to him?	0
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.	0
Oh yeah, sure.	0
Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.	1
And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.	0
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?	0
Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!	1
Oh, you came on to Ross!	2
What?!	2
Now I'm so happy.	1
What are you talking about?!	2
You used the Europe story!	1
That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!	4
How do you know about that story?!	2
How do	0
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!	0
Some guy!!	2
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.	0
Ken Adams!!	2
How we doing, you guys ready?	0
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?	0
Some days it's all I can think about.	0
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.	0
Oh... ok, fine.	0
But... ehm...	0
I just have one question for you,    ehm...	0
When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll...	0
Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok,    let's go!!	1
I can't believe this! How long as this been going on?	2
Well umm, Alexandra has been	0
Oh, it has a name?	2
Phoebe, don't get upset!	3
Okay... Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!	4
Well, Phoebe I thought I'd... ... Yeah, what the hell.	0
Ben!	5
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.	4
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!	5
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?	0
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring.	0
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.	3
Sorry.	3
Sorry!	3
I got my s's back!	1
Which we can celebrate later.	0
Celebrate.	0
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.	1
Rachel, how did this happen?	0
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.	5
Where?	0
At his apartment. Is this juice?	0
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?	4
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.	3
I licked my arm, what?	2
It's breast milk.	0
So?	0
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.	0
What is the big deal?	4
What did you just do?	2
You won't even taste it?	0
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?	0
Aww!	2
Oh sure!  Noo!	1
Ohh!!	2
My apothecary table!!!	2
What?!	2
Noooooo!!	5
Ross, where did you get this?!	2
Oh my God, Phoebe,	4
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!	4
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.	4
How is she?	3
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.	0
How's the hair?	0
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good.	3
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.	0
Can we see her?	0
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.	3
How're you doing?	3
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.	0
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.	1
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.	0
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...	0
Cantaloupe juice.	1
Exactly.	0
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.	2
Uh huh.	0
Oh, you've tasted it.	4
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.	0
Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.	4
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.	4
Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.	0
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.	4
Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.	0
Regina Philange.	0
I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.	2
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.	4
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!	2
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!	4
Well maybe it was all of your questions.	0
What about my questions?	0
No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.	0
Oh, I'll get it.	0
Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.	2
Relax, it's not like we're forking.	1
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!	1
Hey!	1
Hello.	0
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.	1
I know!!!	1
So, I'm here, ready to play.	1
Okay.	0
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.	1
What's this?	2
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.	1
Not one that can pee on the roof.	2
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.	1
And is this in case the house sneezes?	2
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.	0
I don't want a ghost.	5
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.	0
