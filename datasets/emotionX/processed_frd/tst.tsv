Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?	2
Y'know what?	0
It didn't.	0
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.	1
Now, wh-what, what is that like?	2
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.	1
Yeah, yeah.	0
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!	4
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!	1
All right, man!!	1
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!	1
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.	0
Push!	1
Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder.	1
Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!	1
Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.	1
Let's-  I was just-yeah, right.	1
Push!	1
Push!	1
Okay.	0
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?	0
Okay, go left. Left! Left!	2
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!	4
You can do it!	1
You can do it!	1
Okay.	0
You got it?	0
Oh, okay, I get it.	0
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even	5
Howard's the	0
Yes but too me he's just, man.	0
Yeah. I really like his glasses.	0
Ohh!	2
What?	0
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!	2
Oh my God!	2
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.	0
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!	5
They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
You mind if I	0
No, please.	0
So uh, what are you in for?	0
I talk in my sleep.	0
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.	0
So why don't you give me your number?	0
Previously on Friends.	0
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.	0
Oh?!	2
Yeah, but without the costumes.	0
Oh.	0
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.	0
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are: 'They're	0
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?	2
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.	0
What's fish hooking?	2
Huh, what's fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?	0
Well, that makes me feel so good.	1
It was just so awkward and bumpy.	0
Bumpy?	2
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.	0
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.	0
Oh well, it's not so bad.	0
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.	3
Oh!	2
My God!	2
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?	0
Excuse me?	2
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do	3
How's your room Rach?	0
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.	3
Isn't that mine?	0
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?	0
Yes, they can stay with us.	0
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?	0
I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.	0
I don't know if you'd understand.	0
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.	0
Well, y'know.	0
I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time.	5
So I'm gonna go through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.	0
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because they frown on that.	0
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
Ross, we can handle this.	0
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.	3
I mean, enough of the silliness!	4
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!	4
Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?	0
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.	0
Love is the best medicine.	1
Why do you do it?	0
I don't know.	0
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?	0
Yeah, I do.	0
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?	0
Yes.	0
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!	1
Oh.	0
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.	0
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.	0
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!	2
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.	0
'.	0
Have you really done this before?	2
Yeah!	1
Yeah!	1
Yeah!	1
You just take a big, big swing.	0
Now, don't hold back.	0
and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)	0
Hey!	1
Hey-hey-hey!	1
What are you doing?	0
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.	1
Oh, all right.	0
Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.	1
Okay!	1
All right.	0
Bye!	0
Bye!	0
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?	0
Yeah.	0
Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey.	0
Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.	0
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.	0
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!	2
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.	0
Okay.	0
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?	0
Because we can remember them.	0
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played	0
I was always Joanne.	0
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?	0
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.	1
What a wank!	4
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.	4
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.	4
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?	0
I'm, I'm freaking out!	5
Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have!	5
All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.	0
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?	0
Um. yeah.	0
I am	0
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.	0
So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.	0
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.	0
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.	4
!	4
Okay, okay, okay.  I'll get the bagels.	0
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?	0
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.	0
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.	0
Really? A purse?	2
It looks like a women's purse.	0
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,	0
See look,	0
Exactly! Unisex!	0
Maybe you need sex.	0
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.	0
So, um, have you told your parents?	0
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .	0
Here you go.	0
You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.	0
.	0
.	0
I love you Phoebe.	1
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.	2
Hey!	1
Hi.	0
I just came over to drop off nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?	0
So, I guess this is over.	3
What?	0
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.	3
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.	3
Chandler that's crazy!	2
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!	4
So, this isn't over?	0
You are so cute!	1
No, it was a fight.	0
It's nothing to freak out about.	0
Really? Okay. Great!	1
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!	1
We're in a relationship?	2
I'm afraid so.	0
Okay.	0
Hi!	1
So you like the short hair better.	0
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?	0
Can I tell you a little secret?	0
Yeah!	1
I want to keep one.	0
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!	1
Oh, please.	0
What? Honey.	0
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.	0
Oh God, I'm so sorry.	3
I know.	0
Oh God!	2
Got a job on a river boat?	0
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.	0
Right.	0
You like it right?	0
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!	0
Yeah, come here!	0
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?	0
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!	0
Okay, good bye!	4
Hey I got one! I got one!	1
Hi!	1
Hi.	0
Oh uh, up or down?	0
Could you press up too please?	0
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.	3
Oh yeah? How'd yours happen?	0
Well, it's a long story.	0
It's kind of embarrassing.	0
How about you?	0
Car accident.	3
Oh.	0
Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, that's me.  Hey uh, I take it you're just visiting someone.	0
Uh-huh, yeah.	0
Well umm, if you have sometime y'know and maybe you might want to visit someone else	0
Oh yeah! I-I would like that.	1
I'm in the middle	0
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!	4
Uh, you gotta press the button.	0
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.	0
Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.	2
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.	0
Oh my god.	2
What?	2
There's something new in the bowl.	2
No, but I want...I want the pinecones!	1
There's a forest right outside.	0
It's not the same.	0
Thank you for a delightful stay.	1
Oh, my maple candy!	1
Oh my God, what happened?	2
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.	1
Ross's what?	2
Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?	0
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.	2
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria!  I can make sangria!	1
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.	0
Oh.	0
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?	0
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.	3
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.	0
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.	0
Oh, what? What was it?	2
Oh, poor Lily.	3
Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.	3
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!	3
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!	4
Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.	0
Ok.	0
It worked!	2
Umm, she Rach, not it, she.	0
Yeah, I’m not so sure.	0
Well, you're not.	0
Yeah I can!  And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!	1
Monica. You've, you've done it right?	2
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?	4
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!	2
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities.	4
I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.	0
I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right?	0
He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.	0
Y'know, give him my flower.	0
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited	2
Y'know what? You are right?!	2
Yes!!	1
Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever	0
Push, push!	0
Where have you been?	0
Long story, honey.	0
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need- Excuse me, could I have this?	0
C'mon up.	0
So, I hear, you hate me!	4
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.	0
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.	4
So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.	0
Guess what, I got an audition!	1
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.	1
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?	0
You bet! What's the part?	1
Oh it's great, it's a role on	1
Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?	0
I thought he was with you.	0
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.	0
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.	0
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.	0
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.	0
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.	0
Honey, it isn't good luck.	0
Oh my God! Monica!	2
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?	0
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.	0
Are you okay?	0
Uh-huh.	0
Yeah baby!	1
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.	0
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?	0
Who, Josh?	2
What, he doesn't like Josh?	2
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.	0

After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.	2
Yeah, like I could	0

Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.	2
Yeah-no, just that last song.	0
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.	0
Oh yeah, who's playing?	0
The players.	0
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.	0
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.	0
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!	0
Oh.	0
Anything?	0
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.	0
Whose is it?	0
I don't want to say.	0
Diane Keaton.	0
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go!  Come on!  Why aren't you dressed yet?!	4
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.	0
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.	0
Really?!	2
Oh that's so exciting!	1
Thank you!	1
Thanks Mon!	1
Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.	4
Fair enough, now go get ready!	0
Okay.	0
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.	0
My best shoes, so good to me.	1
I wear them everyday.	1
Down at the heel, holes in the toes.	1
My feet's best friends, pals to the end.	1
With them I'm one hot chicky.	1
Though late one night, not much light, I....	0
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.	1
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here.	3
Y'know?	0
No more Joey and Chan's.	3
No more J and C's.	3
"You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?"	0
"Can't, its not there."	0
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.	0
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.	3
Not once did we do that.	0
Hi.	0
Hey!	0
Hi.	0
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.	0
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?	0
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.	0
Uh-huh.	0
I'm not going to do that.	0
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator	0
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?	0
Yeah, okay, give that a try!	0
All right! Let's do it!	1
Woo-hoo!!	1
Yeah, cheerie-o!	1
London baby!	1
Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Monica? What time is it?	0
Uhh, 9.	0
But it's dark out.	0
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.	0
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.	0
I'm	0
I know, me too.	0
Hey!	1
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.	1
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.	0
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!	1
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.	0
Wait! What about Joey?	0
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?	0
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.	0
You didn't bring	0
Hey!	1
Hi!	1
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.	0
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.	0
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.	0
Oh, you're switching apartments?	2
It's not for me, it's for Rachel.	0
But Rachel has an apartment.	0
Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.	0
She is?	2
Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?	2
I guess I didn't really think about it.	0
Damnit!	4
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?	2
Little village people.	0
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.	1
Oh, that is so sweet!	1
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!	1
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.	0
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.	3
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!	3
Wait a minute!	2
Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant.	1
Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.	0
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!	1
Oh, she's gonna love that!	1
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?	0
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.	0
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.	0
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.	4
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.	0
What?!	2
Uh yes, heroin and crack.	0
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!	4
Well, you would know.	0
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?	0
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.	0
I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.	0
I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!	3
Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it's-it's-it's, it's right there .	0
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.	1
Do you really?	0
No, I don't see it!	4
Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?	1
Yeah.	0
Sweetie that's it.	1
That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.	1
You're welcome.	0
Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.	2
Yeah, that's our baby.	1
Gin.	0
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.	1
Okay. All right.	0
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you.	1
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!	1
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!	1
So you uh, want to do something tonight?	0
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.	0
Oh.	0
Oh right!	2

Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy.	3
I mean, I remember a time when	3
Are you okay?	0
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?	1
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was	1
I bet he can.	0
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you're okay?	0
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.	0
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.	0
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.	0
I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.	2
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!	2
Like you, I don't even know where you work?	2
Yeah.	0
Hey.	0
Hey!	0
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.	4

Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .	0
Okay .	0
Here you go.	0
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.	0
Well, if you want, you can work here.	0
Uh, I don't know.	0
Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know?	0
And to go from that to this, I just  Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.	3
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.	0
What?!	2
Flexible hours.	0
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?	0
I have no name.	0
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?	0

You don't know anything.	4
Who's he sleeping with?	0
Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...	0
I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.	0
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.	0
So where did you study?	0
Oh, I didn't go to college.	0
No, where did you study acting?	0
Molly ... people don't study acting ...	0
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?	0
Sure, I'll go check on Emma.	0
Thanx.	0
Will the stable boy never get the princess??	3
You know, this isn't fair.	4
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?	4
Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?	4
I didn't think I could ever love again.	3
Ok	0
Hi, is Molly here?	0
Yeah, come on in. Molly?	0
Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.	0

Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you!	4
Uh Rach	0
Go get back on that case honey!	4
I don't think the next patient is very far along.	0
Okay, well then bring her in.	0
OH .MY .GAWD!!!	2
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!	5
I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?	0
All right.	0
Okay.	0
Hi.	0
Whoa!  I kinda liked it.	1
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.	0
Yeah.	0
We just want you to think it through.	0
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?	0
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.	0
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.	0
Thank you. All right.	0
Come, sit.	0
Sit.	0
Sit!	4
Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.	0
Lucky sixes....	0
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.	0
Hi!	0
And Joey....	0
Hi!	0
And Ross.	0
Hi!	0
He doesn't speak much English.	0
Look at that!	2
So, um... where did Paolo come from?	0
Oh... Italy, I think.	0
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.	0
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!	0
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.	0
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.	0
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.	0
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.	0
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!	2
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.	0
That cup is mine!	4
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!	4
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.	0
Okay.	0
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.	0
I know I do.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
Guess what?	0
What?	0
They published my paper.	1
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.	1
Oh my God.	2
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.	0
Oh.	0
What?! You got us evicted!!	4
I told you not to go down there!	4
Rachel always cries!	4
That's not true!	4
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!	0
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.	0
Go!!	4
All right, all right, all right.	0
I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.	0
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.	0
How ya feelin'?	0
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.	0
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.	0
Woooo hoooo!!!	1
Why, what happened?	2
What is the worse part?	0
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!	4
Nothing!	4
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since.	3
But um, I don't think it's anything serious.	0
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you-Go to the doctor!	2
No way!	4
Damn you 15s!	4
It's a trifle.	0
It's got all of these layers.	0
First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.	0
then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!	0
I like it.	1
Are you kidding?	2
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?	0
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.	0
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!	1
Oh, oh! It's on again!	1
Shhhh!	4
Folks, has this ever happened to you.	0
You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.	0
And there is Kevin.	0
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.	0
Are you intrigued?	2
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!	1
Go ahead.	0
This works with any milk carton.	0
Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.	2
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.	0
Good day for married people huh?	2
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.	3
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?	0
I can't wait to be with you!	1
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.	0
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.	0
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?	3
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.	0
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.	0
Yeah?	0
Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne!	4
I hate you!	4
You ruined my life!	4
Oh, Chandler, Wayne.	0
Wayne, Chandler.	0
Hi, how are ya?	0
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.	0
The reason he just said.	0
What do you need?	0
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?	0
What?	2
And I too am just a love machine.	0
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.	0
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!	2
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!	1
You chipped in?!	2
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.	0
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!	2
This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger.	1
That's always fun to be.	1
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!	4
No I'm not.	0
No!	2
They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!	1
Oh hey, Pheebs!	1
Hey!	1
Oh hey, Ross.	0
Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.	5
Something to think about.	0
Alright, alright, alright...	0
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.	0
For what?	0
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!	1
Thank you!	1
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.	0
I warned you...	0
Who is being loud?	4
Oh, that would be Monica.	0
Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.	0
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?	2
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..	0
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?	2
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.	0
'Kay?	0
Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?	0
Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?	0
Sure.	0
Oh, um, Chandler?	0
Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.	0
Hey Monica, it's Joey!	1
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!	1
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!	0
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?	0
Do you have a dressing room?	0
Do you have a chair with your name on it?	0
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on.	0
Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong!	0
Uh-oh!	5

Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.	0
Everybody smile!  Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at	1
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!	2
Wow, you guys, this is big.	2
OK.	0
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?	0
Well, I never call	0
What 'cha doing?	0
Having a swim.	0
What about the chick?	0
Chicks don't swim.	0
Are you sure?	0
I don't know. Should we try it?	0
Sure.	0
See, I told you they don't swim.	0
Wait. Give him a minute.	0
Noo!  Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.	5
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?	0
You guys feel safe.	0
Right?	0
Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!"	0
Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one.	0
Okay, I'm sorry.	3
I didn't mean to scare you.	3
I just have to clean that up.	0
Okay?	0
'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's.	0
All right.	0
Well, that's just the way that goes.	0
Okay, good.	0
Well, you can't answer.	0
Leslie?	0
Where are you Leslie?	5
Hey!	1
Hey.	0
Oh, there's banana on it.	0
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.	0
How could you not tell me that she has hair?	2
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.	0
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!	4
Why, does she have a bad personality?	0
Hey!	1
Hey.	0
Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.	5
Whoa, for like months?	2
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?	1
No!	2
Oooh, wrong answer.	0
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.	0
Honey, I was wondering....	0
Hmm?	0
Hmm.	0
Yeah.	3
Well honey, what about you?	0
What?	0
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?	0
No.	0
Come on you gotta have one!	2
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!	1
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.	1
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend...  Oh!	2
Oh my God!	2
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.	1
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.	4
That's OK.	0
Oh, are you sure?	2
Really?	2
Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.	4
We can't do that.	0
What? What can't you do?	2
She really said that?	2
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...	0
But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.	0
'Tonight' tonight?	2
Well, I think it's perfect.	1
Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...	0
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.	1
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?	0
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.	0
Alright, well, be good, I love you.	1
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.	4
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.	3
Really stupid.	4
I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.	3
Are we okay now?	5
Yeah. No. No...	4
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.	0
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.	0
You're kidding.	2
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"	0
Oh there it is.	0
That's not your regular dry cleaners.	0
What?!	2
A new grocery store.	0
When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.	4
Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.	0
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.	0
Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.	0
Okay.	0
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s  Wow!	2
What?	2
I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.	2
Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?	0
A little.   Now you're talking.	0
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?	0
I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.	1
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?	1
She must've left.	0
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!	4
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?	2
That's right baby.	1
All right, let me in.	0
What?	2
I'm not a dropper!	4
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?	0
All right.	0
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.	2
Oh my-Oh good God!	2
Baking it didn't help, huh?	0
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.	0
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!	2
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no  It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!	0
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.	0
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!	1
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.	1
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.	0
I was shrieking... like a Marine.	0
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.	0
She's not much of a phone person.	0
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?	0
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.	0
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.	0
Oh, that is so not true.	0
Oh, it is.	0
It isn't.	0
It is.	0
Isn't!	4
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.	0
It's a great class.	1
Thanks.	0
Yeah, yeah, I was watching.	0
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.	0
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them	0
Who? Me the attacker?	2
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you.	3
Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.	3
No-no-Really?!	2
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh	3
Ohh, I'm sorry.	3
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.	0
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.	0
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?	2
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.	0
Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on	0
They're all Chandler.	0
Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!	2
I did.  But it came at a price.	0
But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.	5
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!	2
Sure!	1
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?	0
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!	1
And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!	1
Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.	0
Well, I like that idea.	1
Obviously!	1
I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know?	0
I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like	0
So, that's it?	2
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.	0
Which is why	0
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?	4
No, I'm not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.	0
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!	1
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.	1
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but	0
Cat.	0
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.	1
I love you too.	1
Why?	2
I don't know.	0
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!	1
That's	0
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has	0
But	0
Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.	0
What?! You said he was sweet!	2
He	0
Just don't pick up your phone.	0
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?	2
Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.	0
Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!	0
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.	0
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.	3
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?	3
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.	0
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.	0
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.	3
Chandler?	0
There you are!	2
There you are!	2
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.	0
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?	1
Hi!	1
Hey.	0
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?	0
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.	0
Was she happy you gave her the job?	0
Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.	0
Hello?	0
Oh hey!	2
Can you, can you hang on a second?	0
It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.	0
can you excuse me for a minute?	0
I was just looking over next week's script.	0
Canceled?!	2
Like they're taking it off the air?	2
Ohh.	0
All right, see you Monday.	0
We're not even shootin' them anymore?!!	2
Sorry.	3
I'm sorry Joey.	3
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!	2
It's so secluded up here.	0
I know. I like it up here.	1
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?	5
Honey, we don't have any bears here.	0
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a	0
Okay. I'll be right back.	0
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!	2
What are	0
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!	0
Get up!	4
Here you go honey!	1
Ahh. Thank you!	1
Diet Coke	0
A lesson in the importance of unagi.	0
Ohh,	0
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to	0
All right, so we weren't	0
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe.	0
What are you doing?	0
I'm leaning. This is where I lean.	0
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.	0
Brenda a bee!	5
What?	2
You do?	0
I totally understand.  Can I	0
All right, let's do it!	1
No, no, no. What was that?	2
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.	0
People, people, people.	0
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.	0
Show 'em how it's done.	0
Count it off.	0
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?	0
Yeah, invite him?	0
Hey, did I do these neat enough?	0
Yeah, they're fine.	0
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?	2
Sure. Why not?	0
Really?	2
Yeah?	0
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?	5
But it's absolutely your decision.	0
More tea?	0
Yeah sure.	0
Earl Grey?	0
Hi.	0
Hey!	1
Hey! So how was the doctor?	0
Oh, everything went great.	1
Good.	0
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.	0
I don't see the baby. Where is it?	0
Excuse me?	0
Could you help me with something?	0
The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.	0
And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.	0
I think I know who you're talking about.	0
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?	1
I'm sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff	0
Uh, she's with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.	0
Dr. Drake who?	0
Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.	0
A doctor at this hospital?	2
Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?	4
Hands.	0
Hands!	0
It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.	0
He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!	0
He's in room 816.	0
816, thank you!	1
Thank you.	0
And what is his name?	0
No!	2
Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.	0
Thanks a million.	1
Oh, you're welcome a million.	1
Okay, I'll see you in our room.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh my God.	2
I know.	0
Okay, I gotta go.	0
Whoa! What?! Why?!	2
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.	3
Here?! Now?!	2
Well, yeah.	0
I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.	5
What happened?	2
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.	3
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!	1
Stupid, useless Canadian money!	4
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.	0
Really?	2
Will you call him?	0
Yes!	1
I will!	1
Absolutely!	1
(She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other.	0
She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in	0
Oh my God! That is so good!	1
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.	0
Hey!	0
Hey!	0
What do you got there?	0
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?	0
What are you doing tonight?	0
Huh? Uh	0
Dude! Dude!	2
Oh!  Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?	0
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.	2
What?! Tonight?!	2
That's what Monica said.	0
After she gave me that big speech?!	2
She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?	4
I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!	4
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?	0
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.	2
What?!	2
It's yours!	0
Me too.	0
Hi Jill!	1
Hey!	1
Hi .	0
Rachel.	0
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.	2
Okay. So well I'll umm,  I'll have her home by midnight.	0
I'm sorry, man.	3
Hey, y'know what you should do?	0
You should make something happen for yourself.	0
Y'know, like-like write a play.	0
Write a movie!	1
Huh?	0
I mean, what about those	0
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?	3
Wait a second, I could star in it!	1
Or that.	0
Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?	3
I can't do it.	3
I'll help you.	0
Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.	0
And plus, it'll give me something to do.	0
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?	0
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.	0
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.	0
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.	0
Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.	0
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good.	0
All right.	0
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.	0
I would really love it if I could do both.	0
What?	0
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?	5
What?!	2
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?	4
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.	4
Frannie was the one who found your	0
That bitch!	4
Monica! What	2
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!	4
Hi Frannie, congratulations.	0
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!	4
Why?!	2
Stuart!	4
I believe you know my husband.	0
So it's really a question of	0
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?	2
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.	0
Yeah?	2
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.	0
What's up?	0
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.	0
Man to uh, me.	0
Sure. Okay.	0
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!	2
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.	0
You mean scared.	0
No, I mean happy.	0
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.	1
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.	3
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?	2
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.	0
What?! Over a stupid room!	2
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!	1
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!	1
Yes	0
Shut-out!!	2
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!	2
Yeah, get out!	4
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!	4
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?	4
Come on, wussies!	4
All right, ok, I gotta go.	0
I'm going,  and I'm gone.	0
One more game?	0
Oh yeah!	1
I'm sorry.	3
Ohhh. Don't go.	3
I don't care!  I don't care!!	4
Rachel has those in burgendy.	0
What?	0
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.	0
Um, can you roll your tongue?	0
Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.	0
What, wait, you mean like this?	0
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.	2
Your not doing it.	0
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....	0
Where there is no fear of commitment.	0
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?	0
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.	0
But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.	0
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!	5
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.	0
Right.	0
In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.	0
You think?	0
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!	1
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.	5
Hey!  Hey!	1
Hi!	1
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.	1
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?	1
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.	0
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?	0
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!	2
Y'know she has a face Ross!	4
Wow!	1
That is a good one!	1
Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.	1
Y'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.	0
Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?	0
Together? Like-like to people?	2
Yeah, y'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?	1
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?	0
Uh sure, sure.	0
Bye guys.	0
Is this about Mark?	0
Oh my God.	2
Okay, it's not, it's not.	0
Fine, you're right.	0
Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..	0
Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.	0
It's the semi-finals of her botchy ball tournament.	0
So why can't the three of us go out together?	0
Because uh we-we we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.	3
And the way she looked at me, pure lust.	1
Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?	4
Bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this.	0
Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.	1
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.	4
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.	0
It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.	0
: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!	4
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.	0
What are you doing?	0
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.	0
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.	0
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.	0
Did he call?	0
No. Sorry.	3
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.	0
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.	0
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?	2
Well...	0
No. I...	0
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.	4
Is that too much to ask after six years?!	4
I did not cry my eyes out!!	4
It's like the end of an era!	3
No more J-man and Channie's!	3
Do I know why we're rushing?	0
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?	0
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.	0
Oh, I found it!	1
!	2
That's so great for you guys!	1
Yeah!	1
Good luck, with your girlfriend.	0
Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!	1
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.	0
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.	0
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?	0
Yes, you can, very much.	1
Ahhhh!!	2
Do	0
Ah,	0
Do	0
Ah,	0
All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!	1
And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.	0
And what you said about Nana.	0
And you know what?	0
I think she was.	0
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?	2
You forget how many great songs Heart had.	0
Yeah.	0
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.	0
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.	0
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.	0
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.	0
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.	0
I can't find garbage bags!	4
Oh, I think I saw some in here.	0
What is it?!	2
You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really  proposing?	2
Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?!	2
Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.	3
Okay, look, just do it gently.	0
You’re right.	0
You’re right.	0
I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I’ll be gentle.	0
I can do that.	0
I am a gentle person.	0
Oh, by the  way.	0
Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.	0
Hi, Pheebs?	0
Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.	0
Which	0
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?	0
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.	0
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?	0
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which	1
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here	1
You completely stole my answer!	4
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!	4
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.	0
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.	0
Would ya care to venture one?	0
Would	0
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?	4
Are you just repeating what	0
All right, let's move on.	0
Okay then.	0
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.	0
And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she?	0
Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.	0
You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.	0
Diverse.	0
Did anybody call for security?	0
You be cool.	0
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey?	0
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?	5
Way to be cool, man.	0
What's he talking about?	0
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?	2
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!	4
Okay, who are you?	2
Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right?	4
I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?	4
Marry me.	0
Oh my God! Joey!	2
Hell yeah! I'll marry you!	1
You can't marry him!	4
Phoebe!	2
Why?! Why can't she marry me?!	2
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.	0
Oh my God.	2
It's Joey!	2
Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant?  Who's the father?	2
We don't know.	0
Ohh  I wonder if that dude.	0
There's a dude?	2
Yeah.	0
Who? Who is it?	2
Was that story over?	0
The guy left this.	0
Oh my God! I know who the father is	2
Oh my God, you're back!	2
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!	2
Why do you want to see my hand?	0
Yeah.	0
No!	4
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?	0
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!	1

They are completely different-Okay!	4

Oh, it's okay. I don't	0
Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you!	1
I-I am going to	0
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.	0
No.  And then I called him, and he wasn't there.	0
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.	0
Hello.	0
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.	1
Hey, what do you want to drink?	0
Who's that?	2
Nobody.	0
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?	0
Is that Mark?	0
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....	0
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.	0
Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.	0
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.	0
Sure.	0
Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?	2
If this is your idea of sexy talk?	2
What contracts?	0
Like what?	0

This isn't funny!	4
Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!	4
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!	2
Yes I did! And I put a little	4
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.	0
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.	4
You wanna go down to the office right now?	0
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.	4
Okay I understand.  I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.	0

To see if know what these guys are talking about.	0
Pheebs, how's it going?	0
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?	0
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.	1
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?	0
Oh right, Coach Ruben.	0
Do you know what Pheebs?	0
When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.	5
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.	0
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.	0
What do you mean?	2
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!	4
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!	4
Uh, what was that?	2

Whoa!	2
What is that?!	2
It's nine o'clock in the morning!	2
Can I help you?	0
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?	0
He's not here right now.	0
Oh, you're kidding me!	4
All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.	0
Okay?	0
I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.	0
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.	0
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You're the other one right?	0
What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!	2
Really?	2
I mean hi.	0
No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!	0
Really?!	2
Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.	0
Are you sure?	2
Yes.	0
I guess.	0
Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?	1
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.	5
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.	0
Yeah, I'll take care of it.	0
Okay. I love you so much.	1
Okay we have to do something about your breath.	0

Okay. I can do that.	0
Okay.	0
Surprise!!!	2
Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.	0
Yeah, we're done.	0
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?	2
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?	1
Really?!	2
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.	0
Sweet!	1
All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.	0
Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.	0
I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby	3
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?	0
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.	0
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!	1
Oh, what a fun office.	1
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.	0
So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?	0
Rachel? Do you smoke?	0
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories  about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.	0
What?	0
Peach pit.	0
Yes, Bunny?	0
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-	0
-Peaches?	0
Actually, nectarines, but basically...	0
Could've been a peach.	0
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.	0
All right!	1
Westminster Abbey!	1
Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen.	1
Hey!	1
Okay.	0
What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?	0
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.	0
Really? To what?	2
Man,	0
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And	2
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.	0
That's a mailman! That's	2
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy!	0
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?	0
Hmm.	0
What?	0
Rachel?	0
Yeah.	0
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?	0
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.	0
Yeah?	0
No, you said the baby creeps you out.	0
You said the baby.	0
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?	0
This is going in your book?	2
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!	1
What?! Excuse me!	2
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.	0
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.	0
Yeah!!!!	1
Yes, I made it!	1
I'm on time!	1
Okay, why don't we all uh,  open our books to page 23.	0
Where   Where you will see a uh a bunch of uh red spots.	0
Okay,  umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I-	0
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?	0
What the? What	2
Miss? May I help you?	0
But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.	0
So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	3
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?	0
Do you want me to be afraid of you?	0
Of course not.	0
I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.	1
Really?	2
Of course!	0
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit	0
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is	4
Well, I don't know what else to do.	3
Okay then.	0
Here we go.	0
Ask again later.	0
Later is not good enough.	4
Ask again later.	0
What the hell!	4
This is broken!	4
It-it is broken!	4
All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.	0
Excuse me.	0
Yeah?	0
Are you Phoebe Buffay?	0
Yeah.	0
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.	1
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...	0
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.	1
Come on, two on one.	0
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!	2
What, now?	2
Yes, now is when you swoop!	1
You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!	1
My Catholic friend is right.	0
She's distraught.	0
You're there for her.	0
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!	1
Well, I just called Joshua	0
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.	0
What did he say?	0
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care.	3
I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.	3
Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.	3
Yeah, maybe.	3
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.	3
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?	3
I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.	3
I don't get it!	2
Shh!	4
We're trying to think!	4
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.	0
What?!	2
Oh yeah!	1
I got in there myself once.	0
My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.	0
Yeah.	0
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.	0
All right, you have yourself a deal.	0
Okay.  See?! I told ya!	2
Hey! What's up?	0
Hey-hey, who's your friend?  Hey!!	1
Hey Joey!	1
Erin! Still here!	1
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!	1
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.	1
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!	1
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just	0
Really?!	2
Ohh!	2
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.	0
Really?!	2
Yeah!	1
I mean you definitely should do that.	0
Y'know what, I should do it.	1
Yeah!	1
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.	1
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!	0
All right.	0
This woman's living my life.	4
What?	2
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!	4
You're not an artist.	0
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.	2
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.	0
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!	2
How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!	2
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?	1
No, I meant with the dropper over here.	0
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm	4
Hey Rach, can you pass me the	0
Yep!	0
Go!!	1
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!	2
Oh!	2
Hey!	1
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!	1
Oh, thanks, thanks.	1
So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent.	0
Is that true?	0
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.	0
Pheebs	0
Hey.	0
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.	0
What's the matter?	0
Nothing.	0
Really it's nothing. I'm just	3
Rach come on, what?	0
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.	3
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?	2
Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.	3
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?	0
I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and he's gonna have his own life. Right?	3
Yeah, I guess so.	0
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?	3
Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!	2
I just found out this is Chandler's office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!	1
We said seven!	4
We said six!	4
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.	0
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"	4
Hi!	1
What?!	2
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.	0
You, get out of my shop!	4
Well, what did he do?	2
He went out with my wife!	4
Joey!	2
That's my wife!!! Get out!	4
Well, we should go.	0
Yeah.	0
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.	0
Oh please.	0
Y'know?	0
Well, we're really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.	0
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.	0
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.	0
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.	0
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.	0
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.	1
Yeah?	2
Yeah!	1
Just go for it Chandler.	0
Yeah, you should.	0
Yeah, you should, really.	0
Go on.	0
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.	0
You just ahh, you just need more practice.	0
Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again.	0
Come on.	0
Oh, I	0
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like	0
July. Umm,	0
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.	0
Yeah, I  Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I have to leave.	0
Bye Phoebe.	0
I know.	0
Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?	2
No, I do not hear that.	0
Yeah, I-I heard.  I think it's great!  Ohh, I'm so happy for you!	1
Oh, well, that's great!	1
Yeah! Yeah!	1
I can't believe you're getting married!	1
Yeah.	0
Monica and Rachel made out.	0
Ohhh!	2
Why are we in bed together?	2
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?	0
Yeah.	0
Really?!	2
No!	0
But we-we didn't have sex-uh, did we?	5
I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.	0
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.	1
And we didn't have sex.	0
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.	0
Tell me about it.	0
What are we gonna do?	0
I say we go with	0
Chandler?	0
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?	0
Hi, remember us?	0
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a	0
I am. I'm	0
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.	0
Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.	3
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.	0
Y'know what? It	0
Sorry.	0
I'm so exited!	1
I've been waiting for this for months!	1
I got my hair coloured!	1
I got new sheets!	1
I'm making him a	1
Um-hmm.	0
What am I making him by the way?	0
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.	0
I thought I was making him filet mignon?	2
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.	0
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.	2
Y'know it's like uh, Biology!	0
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.	0
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.	0
You are falling fast asleep.	0
Deeper.	0
Deeper.	0
Deeper.	0
You are now completely asleep.	0
You don't need to smoke.	0
Cigarettes don't control you.	0
You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.	0
A strong, confident woman.	0
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.	0
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.	1
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?	0
No.	0
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.	0
So how are things going with Paul?	0
Good.	1
Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.	3
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.	0
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?	2
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.	0
Hi honey.	0
Hi!	1
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.	5
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!	2
You said number two.	0
I also said number one.	0
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.	0
Can't I just look at the handles on them?	0
You would think.	0
Okay, fine.	0
Because, I don't care.	0
I don't care.	0
What?!	2
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?	2
I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.	0
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!	1
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?	0
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will!  Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!	2
Pretty cool, huh?	1
But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.	0
Umm, can I use your bathroom?	0
It's uh, right through there.	0
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?	1
Yeah, it sure is!	1
You know, I think I was sixteen.	0
Please, just a little bit off the back.	0
I'm still on "no."	0
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?	0
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.	4
What's goin' on?	0
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.	0
I know.	0
See, yes.	0
That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick.	0
I love you both.	0
But in very different ways.	0
Hey!	2
Hey!	2
(sees he's watching	0
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.	1
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!	1
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?	0
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?	0
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.	0
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.	0
Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?	2
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?	0
Because I'm very happy for him!  And	1
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.	0
Okay.	0
All right, let's go say good-bye.	0
Hey!	0
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?	4
Fish!	2
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.	0
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here	3
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.	1
We did have fun, didn't we?	1
We did!	1
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.	0
Oh, I would love to!	1
Yay, okay!	1
Good, good, good, good, good.	1
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.	0
Um...  Done!	0
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!	2
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?	0
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.	0
Why, how much is that?	0
That's about 60 cents.	0
Okay, it's coffee.	0
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!	2
It's-it's hot	0
Hot coffee!!!	2
You idiot!!	4
You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!	4
What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!	4
!	4
What's your favourite thing about summertime?	0
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.	0
Yeah	0
Hey!	2
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?	1
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.	0
OK, try this salmon mousse.	0
Mmmm. Good.	1
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?	0
Yeah, well, is that	0
My God! What happened to you?	2
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!	1
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.	1
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.	0
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.	0
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?	0
I don't see why not.	0
Here's my retainer!	0
Someone in there?	0
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?	2
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.	0
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.	0
Ginger.	0
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....	0
Don't you have to use the bathroom?	0
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you.	0
Yes, I do.	0
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.	0
Someone in here.	0
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!	4
Oh yes there is!	4
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!	4
That was an accident! And so were you.	4
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!	4
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?	2
Oh, just years of experience.	0
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.	1
Say what?	2
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but that's not supposed to be until  later!	0
Oh that was a real person?!	2
I-I-I'm leaving the show?	2
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?	0
Who told you that?	2
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?	2
Umm	0
Feel better?	0
Yeah!	1
Much!	1
Yeah, I understand.	0
Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?	2
I don't think so.	0
Wow!	2
Yeah.	0
Really?!	2
Hm-mmm.	0
$4.50 please.	0
Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.	0
Alright, alright, alright.	0
There you go!	1
Would you like to call somebody?	0
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.	0
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.	4
Oh	0
It's my sister.	0
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the	0
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a	0
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.	0
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.	0
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.	3
Why, nobody good?	0
Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing	0
So how many more do you have tomorrow?	0
Two.	0
This photographer, who seemed really dull.	0
And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'	0
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!	0
What?	0
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...	0
Umm, how's it going with you guys?	0
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.	0
Oh, really?	2
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference	1
Hey!	0
Hi!	0
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?	1
Well, how-how come?	0
That's just the way it is.	0
That's crazy.	2
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.	0
See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now  Peter!	0
Hey, Peter!	0
It's me Rhonda!	0
From PS-129!	0
I gave you my	0
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you.	0
Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he	0
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.	0
Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.	0
How's that coffee comin,' dear?	0
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.	0
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.	0
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?	2
Op.	0
Oh, you got me.	0
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential.	0
Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion.	0
How does that sound?	0
Oh, that sounds great.	1
Come on over here, sweetheart.	0
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.	1
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?	5
No. But thanks.	0
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?	3
Okay. No. But thanks.	0
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.	0
Wow, that was kinda brutal.	2
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.	0
Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know.	0
Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,	0
Yeah, sure.	0
Wow.	2
I'm, I'm really sorry.	0
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.	0
Relieved?	2
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.	0
She wants	0
Oh my God! If you say that one more time,	4
Fine!	4
Fine!	4
But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  'If you accept full responsibility...'  Full responsibility!	4
'...I can begin to trust you again.	4
Does that seem like something you can do.	4
Does it?!	4
!'	4
No?	2
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel.	0
If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.	0
Yeah, I know.	3
I mean, no, you're right.	3
Yeah I guess I'll let it go.	0
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.	3
Sure, it's hard to forget!	0
But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it!	0
A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.	0
What the hell happened on that beach?!	2
It's between us and the sea, Ross!	0
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.	0
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.	3
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.	0
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?	2
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.	0
Oh wow! I'm free for her!	1
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!	2
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?	0
Hold on, y'know I	0
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.	0
Well, I don't really know what that is, but	0
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.	0
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.	0
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.	2
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.	0
Joey, get out of the fridge.	4
What is that?	2
For the ride.	0
Yeah, like in a cab...	0
Save it.	0
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.	0
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.	1
Here we go, here we go.	0
Rossy, Rossy.	0
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.	0
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.	0
Oh my God! Calling from Rome!	2
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.	0
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.	0
You know it?	2
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?	0
Oh, sure, they love us over there.	0
Ben! Ben! Ben!	1
Gimme 'em!	4
No! They are mine!	4
You stole them from me!	4
You stole them from me!!	4
Gimme them!	4
You just wanna each take one?	0
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.	0
Well	0
Why don't you phase it out?	0
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!	0
They're not listening too me?	2
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.	0
I think you look fine.	0
How about Joey... Pepponi?	0
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.	0
Joey... Switzerland?	0
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.	0
Which I'm not.	0
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.	0
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...	0
Might wanna try Joseph.	0
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.	1
Are you kidding?	2
Okay, look.	0
Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey.	0
I'm not arguing with that.	0
You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!	4
Now let it go!	4
The joke sucks!	4
It's your joke.	0
Is not.	4
I didn't!	1
Even when I found out umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.	0
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!	2
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and	0
No.	0
Yes!	1
Then don't touch one!!	4
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!	2
Yeah!	1
Thanks!	1
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.	0
Done!	1
It's not.	0
Or Joseph.	0
Hi!	0
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.	1
Wow! Skates!	1
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?	2
Well...	0
Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection.	1
You want some coffee?	0
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.	0
Regular or decaf?	0
Ah, which ever is closest.	0
Okay.	0
So ask me what I did today.	0
So what did you do today Pete?	0
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.	1
What?! Oh.	2
Hi.	0
Hey.	0
Where've you been?	0
At the vet.	0
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?	5
Hey! He beat ya.	1
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.	3
So what does this mean?	0
I'm gonna have to give him up.	3
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!	4
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?	2
I sure did.	0
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.	2
May I come in?	0
Uh, yeah, if you want too.	0
Do	0
Yeah, sure?	0
So do I.	0
Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.	0
This is just about tonight.	0
I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us."	0
Okay?	0
The physical act of love.	1
What?! Are you crazy?	2
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?	2
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!	2
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!	2
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?	0
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.	5
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.	0
Ah Joey.	0
Joey Tribbiani.	0
Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.	0
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.	0
What?!	2
Aw come on Joey, it's easy.	0
Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!	0
Have fun.	0
Bye.	0
Wow! Fortunately she has a	2
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!	2
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!	2
!	2
Hi there.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.	0
Ok.	0
Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!	0
So, keep having sex on a regular basis.	0
Oh, DAMN IT!	4
Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.	0
Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.	0
Ok.	0
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-	0
Yeah! C'mon!	1
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-	0
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?	0
No, she's at a faculty meeting.	0
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...	0
Come in.	0
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.	0
What's it look like?	0
Kinda like a big face without skin.	0
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.	0
Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.	2
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.	0
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.	1
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.	0
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?	2
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?	2
I have no idea what you just said.	0
Put Joey on the phone.	0
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth	5
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.	0
and that was all before 10 o'clock.	0
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.	0
And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips.	0
Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.	0
We're not gonna be	0
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?	2
Well, up yours too!	4
Where's Chandler?	0
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!	2
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?	0
Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.	0
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.	0
Yeah! You wanna come?	1
Yeah!	1
Fine.	0
Fine.	0
Fine.	0
Fine.	0
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.	0
Hey.	0
Oh Willie's still alive!	2
What are you guys doing?	0
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.	0
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!	2
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this	0
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the	2
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.	3
Oh, here's a great one.	1
Yeah, I'm not in that.	0
I know, but look at me: all tan.	1
Hey, why don't you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.	0
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know	1
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.	0
Chandler what do you say?	0
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.	0
