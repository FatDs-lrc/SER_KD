also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.	0
You must've had your hands full.	0
That I did. That I did.	0
So let's talk a little bit about your duties.	0
My duties?  All right.	2
Now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.	0
I see.	0
But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.	0
Good to know.	0
We can go into detail	0
No don't I beg of you!	5
All right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.	0
Really?!	2
Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.	0
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?	2
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?	2
Ok!	0
All right, well...	0
Yeah, sure!	0
Hey, Mon.	0
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.	0
Do I ever.	1
Chris says they're closing down the bar.	3
No way!	2
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.	0
Got me.	3
Can I get a beer.	0
Hey, did you pick a roommate?	0
You betcha!	1
Is it the Italian guy?	0
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!	2
What, what, what?!	2
What?!	2
He was with her when he wrote this poem.	0
Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside.	0
Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'	0
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!	2
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.	3
Done.	0
What are you doing here?	2
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...	0
Oh.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
How'd did it go?	0
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.	1
I'm so proud of you.	1
Me too!	1
I know.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Ameri-can.	0
Ameri-ccan.	0
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a	0
Everybody!!	2
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!	1
You liked it? You really liked it?	2
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!	1
Which part exactly?	0
The whole thing! Can we go?	0
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?	0
You fell asleep!!	4
There was no kangaroo!	4
That's for coming buddy.	0
I'll see you later.	0
Don't go!	3
I'm sorry.	3
I'm so sorry!	3
Look!	2
Be mad at him!	4
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.	0
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring.	0
See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity	0
Okay, that's enough honey!	0
I don't know.  Let me see the ring.	0
Great! Okay, here.	1
All right.	0
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And	1
What've you been up to?	0
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much.	0
Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.	0
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.	1
I know.	0
I'm back.	0
So, are we gonna get together or what?	0
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?	0
Great, I'll see you then.	0
Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.	1
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."	0
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.	0
Nobody!	4
Nobody respects the bucket!	4
Look!	4
Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?	4
No.	0
This is my wedding.	0
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.	0
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.	1
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!	1
Bye, Pheebs!	1
London baby!!	1
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!	1
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.	1
What?!	2
Nothing!	0
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since.	5
But um, I don't think it's anything serious.	0
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!	2
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!	5
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!	4
I love your place! Where is this guy from?	1
Uh that's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.	0
Oh wow! So, you're more than just dinosaurs.	2
So much more.	0
Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young.	0
Okay	0
But that's not enough. So  So here's a key to my apartment.	0
Really?!	2
Really.	0
You don't think this is too fast.	0
Get Out!	4
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?	0
Yes, please!  So, what's going on?	0
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.	3
Oh my God, wh-what happened?	2
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!	3
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.	3
Hey, you ok?	0
I guess.	3
There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.	0
I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.	0
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.	0
Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.	0
Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?	0
Ok, gentlemen!	4
Please!	4
Aren't we a little old for this?	4
And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first.	1
.	0
GO, GO, GO!	1
Go, go, go!	1
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!	1
What's with all this sand?	2
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.	0
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.	0
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.	4
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.	1
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?	0
Rach? What are you doing?	0
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!	5
It's a diaper commercial.	0
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!	5
Pizza delivery!	1
I'll get it! I will get that!	1
Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?	0
Uhh, the ball thing.	0
Yeah?	0
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!	1
Uhh,	0
Okay!	1
Uh-oh.	5
What?	0
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!	2
I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?	5
Hey.	0
Hey!	0
How did it go with Erin?	0
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!	1
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?	1
You guys were totally right!	1
This is so much better than the first time we went out.	1
Y'know?	0
That was so awkward, we were really nervous.	0
Didn't you sleep together?	0
Yeah, that really calms me down.	0
We have so much in common!	1
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please don't get married before I do.	2
Okay.	0
How does she do that?	2
I cannot sleep in a public place.	0
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.	2
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.	0
What's going on with you?	2
I got no sleep last night!	4
Why?	0
Oh, and deaf.	0
So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.	0
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.	0
Thanks.	1
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?	0
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?	2
Breathe, breathe, breathe.	0
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.	2
How can you not know which one?	2
I mean, was it Gina?	0
Which one is Gina?	0
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.	0
No, no, no, that's Dina.	0
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!	2
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny.	0
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.	0
You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.	0
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.	1
Really!?	2
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.	0
I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.	0
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?	1
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.	5
: I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!	1
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.	1
: Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.	1
: Yeah.	0
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?	0
: Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.	0
Okay.	0
: Yeah.	0
Go get 'em Treeger.	0
: Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.	0
Really?	2
: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.	0
No, I'm good.	0
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so	0
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?	2
Who knows?	0
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.	0
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!	1
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!	1
Yeah!	1
Actually, that can't happen.	0
Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.	0
So it'll be either you two  or you two.	0
Yeah, it is.	0
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.	0
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.	1
And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.	1
I think you've got concussion.	5
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.	1
You're welcome.  I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?	5
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.	2
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.	0
David is going to propose to Phoebe.	1
What?  Why?	2
Chandler, we have talked about this.	4
You are not supposed to give people advice!	4
I	0
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!	4
Oh, that's not what you want...	0
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.	0
It-it's great to meet you Paul.	1
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.	0
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.	0
So Ross, what your problem?	4
Eh-wh-Excuse me?	2
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?	4
That's funny. Umm .  It's not funny.	5
I	0
Okay.	0
I can, I can see that.	0
Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.	5
Okay.	0
What?	0
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.	4
Daddy!	2
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.	0
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.	0
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?	0
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?	0
Ooooohh!	2
Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.	0
Was it...?	2
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.	0
"Ooo," what?	2
Uma Thurman.	0
Oh!	2
The actress!	2
Thanks Rach.	0
So what are you gonna do?	2
You have to tell her!	1
You have to tell her!	1
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.	0
Feminist issue. That's where I went!	0
She is gonna hate me.	5
Yeah, well...	0
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!	1
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?	0
Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?	0
Oh! Oop!	2
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.	0
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!	0
Hi guys.	0
You are beautiful.	1
Oh, thank you!   What's going on?	1
We're just really very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.	0
Okay umm, Ross?	0
I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater.	0
Now, I'm just letting you know that this is	0
Yep! That's hilarious!	1
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.	0
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.	0
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.	0
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.	0
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.	0
What?! You totally get embarrassed!	2
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.	0
Is that so?	0
Yeah.	0
I can't believe it!	2
I did it!	1
I rode a bike!	1
I never thought I'd be able to do that!	1
Thank you Ross.	1
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.	1
Depends on what you mean by we.	0
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me.	0
I mean, you two are-are my  I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good	0
Thanks man.	0
I gotta go check something over here.	0
David?	0
Phoebe! Hi!	1
Oh my God!	2
Wow, you look unbelievable.	1
Yeah. What-what are you doing here?	2
What happened?	2
Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?	0
Yeah?	0
Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.	3
Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?	1
Good!	1
Oh, good for you.	0
Mike and I broke up.	3
It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.	3
Oh my God!	2
I'm sorry.	3
I'm sorry too.	3
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.	0
Wow! This looks great!	1
Call it even?!	0
Well, I'm gonna go get these  in some water.	0
Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?	2
No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby.	0
Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.	4
Hey!	2
My sweater!	2
I've been looking for this for like a month!	2
Oh my God!!	2
Oh my God!	2
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be!	4
Huh?	2
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!	4
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.	1
I have a question about this scene.	0
Yes?	0
Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.	0
Yeah.	0
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.	0
Oh, hey, how about this one.	0
It doesn't say that in the script.	4
Y'know who has a great video camera?	0
Greg and Jenny?	0
Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.	0
Let's call 'em.	0
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!	1
Hello?  Eighth street deli?	0
Here you go.	0
Hello?   It's the deli again!	2
All right! I'll have a sandwich!	1
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now	3
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?	2
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.	0
Sure. So how long you been...	0
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?	0
Since then?!	2
No, it's only been six years.	0
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.	0
...Joe.	0
Y'ever been in love?	0
...I d'know.	0
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.	0
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.	0
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.	2
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?	0
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.	2
Hey, Rach, how was work?	0
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.	0
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.	0
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.	0
I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...	0
Something wrong?	0
No. Nothing.	0
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.	0
Yeah, that's it?	2
Yeah.	0
Yess!!	1
We're teeth people Zack!	1
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!	3
It's not that bad.	0
So, you're just Bing?	0
Because we won our apartment back!	1
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!	2
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha!	2
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.	0
Okay.	0
Uh-huh, not as high as  It worked! King!	2
Yeah baby!	1
But, we pick again! We pick again!	1
Why?!	0
Tickets please!  That's courtside baby!	1
Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!	2
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?	0
It's gonna be worth it.	0
It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?	0
Women love guys who love babies.	0
It's that whole sensitive thing.	0
Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.	0
Maybe one of them will break away.	0
All right, gimme the baby.	0
No, I got him.	0
Oh, seriously you want him?	2
Hello.	0
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?	2
You wanna smell him?	0
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.	1
Well, we are great guys.	0
Bye.	0
Well, not really.	0
I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.	0
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.	0
I mean what's more important?	0
What people think or how you feel, huh?	0
Ross, you gotta follow your heart.	0
Joey that is so sweet.	1
Hey.	0
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?	0
I couldn't do it.	3
You couldn't do it?!	2
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.	0
What?! You're going out with her again!	2
Going out with who?	0
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.	0
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh	2
No, that was Dana Caplin.	0
Joey! You didn't even know her!	2
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!	1
Don't touch him!	4
Okay!	2
All right.	0
Umm, all right Wayne, level with me.	0
Okay?	0
I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.	5
Ah-ah!!	2
Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right?	2
Here you go!	0
Okay?	0
Stupid!	4
I can't believe it!	2
God!	4
Hey, how you doin'?	0
Hey.	0
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.	0
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?	4
You had no	4
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.	4
But I told you, I didn't have the time!	4
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.	4
Wh, Ross what do you want from me?	4
You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?	4
I know.	0
What?	0
But I can't tell you.	0
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.	0
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.	0
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?	0
No.	0
Does it have to do with Joey?	0
No.	0
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?	0
No, but let's come back to that later!	0
Hi!	1
Richard!	1
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.	0
Ohh  Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.	0
Like I have nothing better to do!	0
So what's up?	0
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.	1
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?	0
No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.	1
Maybe!  Well! Well so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!	4
Joey, I am scared to death about this.	5
But I really think I can do it, I'm just gonna need some help.	5
And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.	0
You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.	1
Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?	4
And you're my big brother!	1
I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world.	0
I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad.	0
I was scared of telling you.	5
Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.	3
I want him to have his uncle.	3
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?	3
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!	1
We're gonna be all right. I mean, even if we're not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.	1
That's right! By his uncle too!	1
And by you.	1
Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.	0
I had a really nice time tonight.	1
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.	1
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.	0
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw	2
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.	0
Hi!	1
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!	2
Like it would help.	0
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.	0
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.	2
Hi Mom, it's Jill.	0
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!	2
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.	0
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.	0
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.	0
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was	1
Are you seeing anybody right now?	0
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?	0
Uh-huh.	0
There's gravy?	2
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.	0
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.	0
What are you doing?	0
I think I left a donut up here.	0
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy.	0
Great job team!	1
Tomorrow at 8:30.	0
Nice job.	1
Way to go!	1
Joel-burg, you maniac!	1

Oh then you know each other.	0
We're on a semi-first name basis.	0
What do you think of adding him to our team?	0
Really? They love him down on six.	2
But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.	0
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!	1
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?	0
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!	1
What?	2
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film that Batman film he was in.	1
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!	4
So?	0
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.	3
Well then we still have a problem.	0
Yeah!	0
With what?	0
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.	0
Oo! You should have one of us do it!	1
Phoebe, we're getting	0
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!	1
Are you serious?	2
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!	1
I call it!!	1
What?! No! It was my idea!	4
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.	0
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!	4
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!	0
See, I see.... big passion in your future.	1
Really?	2
I do.	0
Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]	1
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.	0
Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.	0
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.	0
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.	0
What?!?!	2
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.	0
You can spill. In the sink.	0
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.	3
I love you, too.	1
What? I'm just said.	3
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.	0
Oh my God! Are you serious?!	2
Uh-huh.	0
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!	1
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.	0
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!	1
I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.	3
You just saved me!	1
You're my hero!	1
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.	0
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!	1
No.	0
No, I won't.	0
But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.	0
Okay, that's a lie.	0
What happened?	0
I ended up at Ross's place.	0
Oh, I musta missed counted or something.	0
Damn!	4
Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.	0
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.	0
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.	1
Lose the robe.	0
Me?	2
That's great.	1
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?	0
No, no, I'm still working on mine.	0
That's it?	2
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.	0
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!	1
Pretty nice?	0
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.	0
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.	0
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.	0
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!	0
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!	4
Pheebs?	0
Yeah?	0
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.	0
One ticket to Yemen?	2
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.	0
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.	2
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?	0
Are you travelling with a child?	0
No.	0
All right, y'know what, she's  gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.	0
Okay, but this is the last time.	0
With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.	1
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.	1
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
How's she doing?	0
She?	2
I don't know.  I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.	0
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.	0
What?	0
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.	0
Well sensitive is important, pick him.	0
Yeah.	0
Jason is not a sissy!	4
Hi.	0
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?	0
Yeah.	0
Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter.	0
I mean, I think it would've happened either way.	0
I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.	0
It was an amazing night.	1
It was. It was an amazing night.	1
Do we have a name yet?	0
No, not yet.	0
That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.	0
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.	0
Hello baby girl.	1
Why is Ross doing that?	0
DANGER	5
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!	2
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.	0
Really?	2
Yeah! Look!	0
I know.	0
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.	0
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?	0
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!	1
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so	2
Also so	0
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!	0
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!	0
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.	0
About what?	0
He's planning your birthday party.	0
Oh my God! I love him!	1
You'd better act surprised.	5
About what?	0
My surprise party!	1
What surprise party?	2
Well, he didn't tell me.	0
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.	0
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.	4
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.	0
Yuh-huh!	4
Looks like I was second to last.	2
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.	0
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.	0
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.	4
It's not like we run in the same circles.	0
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.	0
Okay?	0
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.	0
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.	0
Hello! Who's in there?	0
How ya doin'?	0
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?	0
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!	5
Not after this!	4
Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.	0
I gotta go.	0
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.	0
Okay.	0
So Pheebs, what is the book about?	0
I thought you said you read it in high school.	0
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?	0
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?	0
Y'know what, actually   Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?	0
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?	0
Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?	0
And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"	2
But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.	0
We get high.	0
Oh, me too.	0
I'm kidding.	0
Yeah.	0
Does it still hurt?	3
Yeah.	3
Hi.	0
Hey, how'd it go?	0
Excellent.	1
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.	1
You know what? You are right. I	0
Good for you Pheebs!	1
Ok.	0
Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean	0
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!	4
It's 6:00.	0
Yeah, well	0
Hi!	1
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.	0
Handling it?	0
Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.	0
Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!	4
What?	2
And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off.	0
I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.	1
What the hell is this?!	2
What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?!	4
This sucks!	4
All right, what's my next present?	0
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?	0
Ennnh.	0
I've got canned goods.	0
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!	2
Excellent hole, Joe.	0
Oh no! No!! My hole!!	2
What?! What?!! What is it?!	2
My drinking?	0
Oh, I must've said that after you left.	0
That you enjoyed the occasional drink ing binge.	0
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!	5
If you're gonna get all sensitive about it!	4
I don't want to lose you.	3
What if I, create a position for you?	0
I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.	0
Say more things like that.	1
I'd need an expense account.	0
Done!	1
And an assistant.	0
Sophie, get in here!	1
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.	1
Oh my!	2
They're male nurses.	0
Not in my head.	0
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?	1
What?	2
What are you talking about?!	2
I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.	0
Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.	0
Umm, why don't you give	0
What?	2
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?	0
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some	0
Yep! There's always room for	0
Joey, how do you make	0
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad	0
Hello, this is Monica...	0
Yeah???	0
Oh...	0
Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.	0
Thank you.	0
Okay. Let's bring it in.	0
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.	0
Here you go.	0
That almost hit me in the face.	4
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.	0
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.	1
Oh boy, me too!	1
Y'know I was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours	0
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!	0
That's me! Come on!	1
Okay.  But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.	0
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.	0
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.	0
Hi! Nice to meet you!	1
Nice to meet you too.	0
So, are you ready to go?	0
Yeah.	0
I'll be right with you.	0
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.	0
Y'know?	0
Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.	0
Y'know?	0
You can take it off.	0
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?	0
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.	0
Well that's not a third nipple.	0
No?	2
First of all, it's on your ass.	0
Well then, what is it?!	2
Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?	0
I'm with Hamilton!	0
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.	0
It's from France In Europe Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.	0
Really?	2
Uh-hmm-Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.	1
I studied for a year in Barcelona.	0
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking	0
I love hiking!	1
Oh that's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo	1
I get it!	1
So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.	2
No-no. We	5
What?!	2
Um uh We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all.	0
Why?!!	2
Uh well umm we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this.	0
Oh. Well then shut me up.	0
Just tell me how.	0
Let it go, Ross.	0
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.	0
Do you all promise?	0
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?	0
Hey, Pheebs.	0
'Dear Ms. Buffay.	0
Thank you for calling attention to our error.	0
We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.	0
We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -	0
Bye bye.	0
Yes?	0
Whatcha doin'?	0
Ooh.	0
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the	0
Honey, both yours.	0
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!	1
Yeah? The work problem?	0
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.	1
What problem did you tell him you had?	0
Oh that's not important. The point is, I really-I think everything's gonna be okay.	0
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?	0
Very good,  so good.	1
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.	1
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call.	3
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.	0
Remember, a virgin for me please.	0
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.	0
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.	0
Well, if you think it will help.	0
No!	4
Ohhh!!	4
I think somebody needs another lap dance.	1
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.	0
You do?	2
You don't?  Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.	2
Hey.	0
Hey! How was sailing?	1
Wow thanks!	1
Yeah!	1
Uh, you've had a lot of sex right?	0
When? Today? Some, not a lot.	2
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn't .	5
There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.	5
Don't worry about that man, that happens.	0
It's happened to you?	2
Yeah! Once.	0
Well, what'd you do?	2
I did it anyway.	0
'Sup? 'Sup dude?	0
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.	5
So you're playing a little	0
Come on man, really how old?!	2
And they knew about it?	2
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?	2
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!	4
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!	4
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?	0
I didn't wanna leave him alone.	0
Alright?	0
We- we had our first fight this morning.	0
I think it has to do with my working late.	0
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...	0
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.	0
Oh, that'd be great!	1
Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.	0
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.	0
All right, check it out.	0
Check this out.	0
"It's almost as good as being there."	0
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!	1
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!	1
Uh, may I help you?	0
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.	0
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.	0
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.	0
Nobody sees the king!	4
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.	0
Hey! You can't go back there!	2
Oh my God.	2
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?	0
I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.	0
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a	3
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?	2
Yeah.	0
My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.	0
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.	0
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.	0
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.	0
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.	0
And now you want that money back.	2
Exactly.	0
I don't know.	0
But I can see through your sheet.	0
Yeah, yeah, that's her.	0
But y'know what?	0
Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.	3
Why?	0
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.	3
What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!	2
No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.	0
And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.	0
You've been counting wrong.	0
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?	2
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.	0
Come on!	1
Okay.	0
All right, gentlemen, you're up first.	0
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?	0
Big fat goalie.	0
Correct. Rachel claims	0
Dangerous Liaisons	0
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...	0
Weekend at Bernie's	0
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.	0
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!	1
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!	4
Okay.	0
I'm sorry.	3
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.	2
You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.	5
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.	0
Pete, can I get you something else?	0
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.	0
Haven't you and I covered that topic?	0
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you .	0
Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?	0
I mean really, think about it.	0
Ho-ho, I will.	0
I believe I read that somewhere!	2
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!	4
It's not funny!	4
!	4
I respectfully disagree.	0
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!	4
Who cares? Nobody reads those things	0
I don't have a page.	0
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?	2
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.	3
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?	1
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.	1
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?	2
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice	3
You	0
Why?	0
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!	1
Ohh, it's time to go.	0
Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?	0
Twice?	0
Well that's ambitious.	0
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.	0
That's Carol with your son!	2
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!	1
Oh come on! Morning's here!  Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!	1
I	0
Are you kidding? I love that guy!  Morning's here! Morning is here-	1
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.	0
Y'know what? I am	0
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.	3
Okay.	0
See, this is a	0
Shut up! This place is a hole!	4
All right buddy, time to roll over.	0
Are you under the sheet?	0
Yes.	0
Great, let's begin.  How's the pressure?	1
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!	1

All right, I guess this will be fine.	0
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?	0
Nothing, why?	0
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.	0
I'm not asking you to go on a	0
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.	2
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends.	0
Just take him to like a ball game or something.	0
I'll really appreciate it.	0
Yeah, okay.	0
Yeah?	2
Sure, no problem.  Ooh-Hey, donuts!	1

Come on, pick up, pick up!	5
Hello?	0
Transit Authority?	0
Yes, hello.	0
I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.	0
Hi, here's the deal.	0
We lost a carseat on a bus today.	0
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.	0
Oh, and there was a baby in it.	0
He wants to talk to you again.	0
Hello.	0
I'm sorry I'm a little late.	0
Ah--Whoa!	2
Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.	0
So to sum up, I'm Professor Geller.	0
Good evening, sir.	0
My name is Ross Geller.	0
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.	0
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry.	0
Man, I wish I was naked.	0
I mean, this-this looks so great.	1
That is how God intended it.	0
Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!	1
My turn? What-what are you talking about?	2
What?!	2
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."	0
And he said, "Laundry?	0
Is	0
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big  ot.	0
What?!	2
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most	0
Me and Chandler?!	2
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.	0
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?	0
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!	1
A test?!!	2
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!	1
Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?	0
I'd have to say the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you're making me eat him.	0
Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? I'm sorry.	2
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.	0
I think it's best sir.	0
But we really do need to find someone up here.	0
The work is starting to pile up.	0
I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.	0
Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em.	0
That's a good one.	0
What does a guy have to	0
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.	0
Hi, Julie!	1
Isn't there a national football league.	0
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.	0
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.	3
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?	1
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.	0
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?	0
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?	0
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.	0
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as too many women.	0
Really?	2
Yeah, for you!	1
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!	2
That's	0
Oh, uh..	5
I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?	5
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!	2
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!	4
I feel like I can't do stuff!	4
You cook naked?	2
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.	0
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.	2
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.	0
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.	0
You think you know me so well.	4
Well, don't 'cha wanna?	0
Yeah.	0
Okay, well I do know you.	0
That's what I said.	0
Well so?	0
I can't.	3
I can't.	3
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone.	3
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.	3
Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.	0
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?	0
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.	0
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.	1
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?	2
This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear-you want it to be dirty?	2
No.	0
There you go.	0
That's the rule.	0
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!	4
You knew about that?	2
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?	0
Yeah	0
Why not?	0
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?	0
I'm not moving out.	0
You'd tell me if you were moving out right	5
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...	0
Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.	0
No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.	0
Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.	1
Aw forget it, it's from	0
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I'm gonna kill you!!	4
Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.	3
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.	1
Yes, exactly!	1
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!	1
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.	5
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!	2
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?	0
I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!	1
It's	0
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry.	3
You're right.	0
Y'know what?	0
I'm asking you to do me a favor.	0
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.	0
Oh my God!	2
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?	0
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-	0
-leg?	0
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.	0
You actually broke her watch?	2
Ooh, steer clear of you.	2
That's right.	0
Barry, I'm sorry...	3
I am so sorry...	3
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...	3
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan.	0
Okay, okay, bye	0
So what are they doing?	0
Hey, you're early.	0
What are you doing with the lamp?	2
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.	0
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.	0
You're disturbing my oboe practice.	4
I could play the oboe!	4
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!	1
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.	1
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!	4
What is going on?	2
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!	4
Ross!	2
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!	4
What do I have to do to get some service?!	4
Hi Rach.	0
Ross?	0
Yeah?	0
Hey it's Mona! From the wedding.	1
Oh hi!	1
Hi!	1
Wow! Uh how are you?	2

Oh you're serious. Sure!	2
I think I might need one more cup of coffee.	0
Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.	0
Okay.	0
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.	3
Go!	4
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?	2
I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit.	4
I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.	0
Oh God  Oh, he's in there right now?	2
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?	0
Really? Are you sure?	2
Oh Phoebe!	1
Okay, sorry. Yeah.	0
Hey Rach.	0
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.	1
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and    I wanted to share it with you.	1
Oh, you're so wonderful.	1
It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.	0
Wanna peek?	0

Did he tell you?	2
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?	1
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.	1
Isn't this great?!	1
Don't spoil it.	0
Hi.	0
Hi, sweetie!	1
Hello.	0
Hi, Ross.	0
Yeah, huh.	0
I've got some bad news.	3

Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.	0
Okay, then.	0
Okay.	0

So, see ya on Saturday.	0
Yeah, you bet.	0
Whazzup??	0
Listen, can you do me a favor?	0
I'm gonna be out today.	0
Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?	0
You don't trust him?	2
I think the check in is that way.	0
Ahh.	0
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!	0
There are?	2
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!	2
That's right.	0
Chandler	0
You just told me that he hates marriage!	2
You got	0
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.	5
I knew.	0
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.	2
I did.	0
Oh.	3
Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?	5
Sometime?	0
Maybe?	0
Okay... okay, maybe I will...	1
Why?	2
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.	0
Well, you're amazing.	1
Oh no-no-no.	0
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?	2
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.	1
Oh-no-no-no, you are!	1
You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.	1
You mean with Casey.	0
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.	0
Or Casey.	0
No-no, Kathy.	0
Could be Casey.	0
No. No, Kathy.	0
Consider Casey.	0
I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey.	1
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!	1
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?	0
Honey, what's the matter?	0
I just saw Janice.	0
I like her.	0
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?	0
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.	0
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more	0
beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .	0
Okay, my next song's called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say.	0
I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.	0
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.	0
Yes, hello.	0
I have a question.	0
Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.	0
A beard and a moustache.	0
Thank you.	0
No,	0
What?! What else did he say?	2
Umm, he said he thought I was funny.	0
So  Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.	0
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.	0
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!	0
Okay?	0
And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna	0
Okay, there was	0
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't	0
Oh yeah? Okay.	0
Okay.	0
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?	2
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!	2
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?	0
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?	2
Oh right, right.	0
Well usually...yeah!	2
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.	0
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.	0
I'm such a jerk.	3
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.	0
Hmmm... this is so nice.	1
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.	0
OK.	0
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....	0
Ohhh!!!!	2
Yes, yes, that's right...	0
Oh, look at the little cat!	2
What?  Ow!	2
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.	0
I didn't mean	0
It's brilliant!	1
Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!	1

Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.	0
What musician?	2
We did?	0
Thank you. Thank you so much!	1
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.	0
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?	2
All right, I'm nine years old.	0
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.	0
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.	3
Oh my god.	2
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.	3
Hey, who's this little naked guy?	2
That little naked guy would be me.	0
Aww, look at the little thing.	2
Who are those people?	2
Got me.	2
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.	0
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?	2
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?	0
Looks like a fun gang.	0
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!	1
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.	0
No.  This is my red sweater.	0
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.	5

Chandler Bing!	2
Jan-Janice!	2
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.	0
Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?	2
It's you. This is yours.	0
What?!	2
Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!	1
That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?	5
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here.	0
I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.	0
Yeah? Really? No one's home?	2

You had no relationship!!	4
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!	4
Oh God, stop with the plan!	4
So what, so what you saw him with a girl?	0
Who cares?!	4
That doesn't mean anything!	4
Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.	0
You're right.	0
All right, I'm just gonna go on the date.	0

Oh, that's Ross's.	0
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.	2
Remembered what?	0
It was like months ago.	2
Oh!	2
I can't believe he remembered!	2
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.	2
I can't believe he did this.	2
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?	0
What did you just say?	2
F-hah.... flennin....	5
Oh.... my God.	2
I really like waking up with you.	1
I like waking up with you too.  Oh! It's such a beautiful morning.  Oh, I can stay here all day.	1

I do not always have to be-okay, okay.	4
Jurassic Park	0
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.	5
Maybe we should check the trash chute.	0
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.	0
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.	0
Hey!	0
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!	4
Just, y'know out.	0
What were you doing?	0
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.	0

He has the most amazing Porsche under there!	1
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in.	0
She's sleeping.	0
Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?	0
Well, the old lady died.	3
And how do I know?	0
Her dying wish was for one last kiss.	0
Yes!	1
Isn't that great?	1
Oh, yeah!	1
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.	0
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.	2
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know.	0
You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.	0
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.	0
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right.	0
Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?	0
Okay, great.	1
Thank you.	1
Um, coffee to go, please.	0
Isabella Rosselini.	0
Are you serious?  Oh my God.	2
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?	0
Yeah, maybe.	0
What you don't think I'd go up to her?	0
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.	0
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.	4
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.	0
Okay, hold my crawler.	0
Okay.	0
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?	2
Okay, that's, that's enough.	0
'....	0
A-ha!!!	2

Okay that's fair.	0
All right.	0
Good!	0
Pick one.	0
Left!  Thank you.	1
You're welcome.	0
Ross!	2
Yeah absolutely!	1
Yeah.	0
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.	3
Oh that's all right!	1
Y'know, I ended up having a really good time.	1
Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.	1
So what was it for anyway?	0
I wanna say a disease.	0
Hey!	2
Hey!	2
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on	0
Huh. All right.	0
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!	2
Oh-oh Professor Geller.	0
Ahh, to be 13 again.	0
Yeah.	0
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?	0
No! He blew us off!	4
What?!	2
I know!	2
I can't believe it.  Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.	4
Can I tell you something? Me too.	4
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him	4
Ooooh! Freeze him out.	1
That's right!	1
I like it!	1
Doorknob?	0
Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.	0
Oh good.	1
Look, I   Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.	5
So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet.	3
It's-it's too soon.	5
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.	2
No. I think you misunderstood what	2
You are so adorable.	1
That! Let's talk about that.	1
Hey!	1
How do you feel?	0
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.	0
Okay, so I	0
And protected them from a tornado?	0
Oh my God.	2
I know, the babies are asleep.	0
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!	2
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!	1
But my apartment!	2
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.	0
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.	0
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out.	0
'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!	0
When will that be?	0
!	0
Hey!	1
Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!	1
What?! It is?!	2
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping	1
A dreamless sleep.	0
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!	0
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.	0
Okay.	0
When are you coming home?	0
What? Guys, I'm not.	2
C'mon, this is us.	0
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-	0
Waitressing?	2
Okay, I'm not just waitressing.	0
I'm..	0
I, um...	0
I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh...	0
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?	0
So, um, will you bring the truck?	0
I'll even let you ring the bell.	0
Oh, my god.	2
They're nice guys.	0
Oh, they're firemen guys.	1
Your son.	0
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.	4
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.	0
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,	2
I got it.	0
I got it.	0
No, you don't.	0
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.	4
Why?	2
He started it!	4
You did!	4
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.	4
But...	0
Now go!	4
Yeah, listen...	0
Out	4
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.	0
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.	2
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.	0
Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.	0
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.	0
Boutros Boutros Gali.	0
He says he was too.	0
Interesting.	0
So I was wondering....	0
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.	1
So you're a chef?	0
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.	1
Oh, really.	2
Well, I was having a conversation.	0
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.	4
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?	4
That would be great. Thank you.	0
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.	0
When did that happen to you?!	2
Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.	1
Here, I'll get it.	0
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.	0
Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.	1
That was unbelievable!	2
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.	3

Thanks a lot.	1
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.	0
I know.	0
So Chandler, your parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.	1
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.	0
I remember when we first got engaged.	1
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.	0
What a sweet story.	0
What?! They wanted a scary story!	2
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.	1
What?	2
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.	5
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?	2
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,	0
Did that!	1
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.	0
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!	2
Was it not pain-free?	2
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.	0
But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.	0
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!	2
now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.	0
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.	0
Do you wanna start telling secrets?	0
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.	0
One, two, three, four!	0
You know the song! Sing along!	1
So?	0

It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?	0
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides	0
Okay, Mon, back me up here.	0
Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?	0
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?	0
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.	3
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal.	0
Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it.	3
Y'know, hey I understand.	0
Y'know?	0
Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right?	0
So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool.	0
I'll see you tomorrow.	0
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.	0
All right?	0
And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"	1
Yeah that's the same.	0
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?	0
Which one?	0
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.	3
Y'know, for me anyway.	3
And of course, the Indians.	3
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!	4
Hi, guys.	0
Hi! Phoebe.	1

I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.	3
Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!	1
No leg-chewing for us sir.	0
Oh well, give it time.	0
So the divorce, the marriage, we've got a lot to celebrate.	1
How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?	0
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.	1
They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!	1
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow!	1
Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow.	0

Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.	0

Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?	0
Oh, great!	1
Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery.	0
I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.	0
You're a genius, Ross.	1

Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.	0

Hey, Pheebs?	0
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!	4
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.	3
And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.	0
Uh-huh!	1
Wow! Cool!	1
Was the chord at least right	0
Well, this has been fun.	0
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.	1
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.	0
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457.	0
And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.	0
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....	0
I'm really glad we came.  You're so pretty. I love you.	1
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.	0
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office.	0
What are you doing?	0
I'm sorry.	0
But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.	0
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.	0
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?	0
I don't have ten minutes!!	4
What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?	0
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!	4
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.	3
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.	0
Yeah, but wait...	0
Good bye!	0
Actually, that's our three hole punch.	0
Oh yeah? When?	2
All right.	0
I'll tell you what.	0
When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?	0
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?	2
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.	0
No, no, no.	0
Uh, uh.	0
Well?	2
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!	2
Hey.	0
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.	2
Did you go home and change?	2
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?	0
No, I haven't seen him.	0
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?	2
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?	0
Yeah, why?	0
No reason.	0
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!	1
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?	2
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!	1
Yeah, that's her.	0
Thank you.	0
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!	2
Y'know what would work?	0
Hmm?	0
Stop making candy!	4
You mean they like you.	0
Maybe.	0
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?	2
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?	4
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'	4
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?	2
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!	1
What? We could do it!	2
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8	0
Now you do that, you're on TV.	0
Hey!	1
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...	0
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?	0
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.	0
Well, I like it. Here you go.	0
Oh, I embarrass you?	2
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?	0
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?	0
They're all tourists.	0
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!	4
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?	2
What?	2
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.	4
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my	0
Whoa, whoa, whoa.	2
You don't even know me...	4
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.	2
What?	2
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.	3
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...	3
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?	0
Oh yeah.	0
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop!  Okay, back-Stop!  Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!	0
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.	0
Is this yours?	0
Well actually	0
Dude, you soooo need this car.	0
Okay.	0
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.	0
You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.	0
Okay?	0
All right, here we go.	0
!	0
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.	0
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...	0
...and live forever as a machine!	1
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?	1
You and I, we're interfacing.	0
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!	1
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.	0
Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.	0
See?	0
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.	0
Oh, I should go, too.	0
Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.	0
I asked him.	0
So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!	1
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!	0
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.	0
Ok, that'll be great!	1
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.	1
Hello Skidmark.	0
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.	0
It's pretty clear.	0
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.	0
That's why you broke up with me?	2
Ni-chou chi-ma!	1
Hi everyone.	0
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.	0
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.	0
What did, what did he say?	5
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.	0
So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.	0
.	0
.	0
Oh, great!	1
We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.	1
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"	1
And did he?	0
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.	1
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.	0
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.	1
Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again, am I?	3
Oh my God!	2
I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up!	2
I mean, I I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.	3
You'll have a last kiss.	0
Thank you so much for coming back over.	1
I know Mona, just hear me out.	0
First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.	0
You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.	0
Focus.	0
Okay. Um But-Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are	0
All right where's that turkey!	0
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!	2
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!	1
No.	0
No!	4
Ahh.	0
Oh, would you look at that Monica?	1
I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.	1
Okay, I'm next.  Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!	4
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.	1
Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!	4
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?	0
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.	0
Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.	0
No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!	1
That's right!	1
'Cause I'm a Tribbiani!	1
And this is what we do!	0
We can eat!	1
Well?	0
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.	2
Look at this!	1
Oh! You have a window!	2
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...	1
Oh look! That guy's peeing!	2
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
Ohh.	0
Okay. Let's use this brush.	0
Okay. This stuff?	0
Yeah.	0
All right.	0
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.	0
Oke-dokey.	0
Where exactly is your zoo?	0
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.	0
Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?	0
Yes.	0
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?	0
Even if he were... cornered?	0
Well I, I don't know. Why?	0
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?	0
How about a hammer, or a small blade?	0
Otherwise it's just cruel.	0
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.	1
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...	0
...He's in.	0
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!	1
I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.	0
Really helped speed the process along!	1
Janice!	2
You're not... gone?	2
Oh!	2
Sid is still in his room.	0
So did you do it?	2
Did you make your deposit?	0
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!	1
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?	5
Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.	0
You can't have it.	4
Give it to me!	4
No	4
I'll go in there.	4
Phoebe come here	0
Haha!	1
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!	4
I just had sex.	0
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?	2
Well, you never told me how old you were.	0
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...	1
Don't say it.	5
...in love with you.	1
Really?	2
Sorry.	3
Well,fall out of it.	4
You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.	4
Who?	0
Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?	0
You. Like you haven't done enough.	4
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.	0
I mean I wish I were a seahorse.	0
Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies.	0
Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end	0
Oh Phoebe, that's a great story.	0
Oh God, get out!	4
Get out!!	4
Get out!!	4
Get out!	4

Let's.	0
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.	1
Oh my God .What's he gonna do now?	5
I can't watch!	5
Oh.	0
Terrified.	5
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!	1
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.	0
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?	2
Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.	0
I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.	0
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I	0
Fine! Maybe I will too!	1
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!	4
What's the matter, Pheebs?	0
What?!	2
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.	3
She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is.	3
She knows, and she won't tell me.	3
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!	3
Yeah, well, don't 'Aww Pheebs, that sucks!' me yet.	3
Where ya going?	0
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.	0
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.	5
Well, are any of those people here?!	4
Oh my God, so do I!	2
I knew it, wow!!	2
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?	0
Ohh, so cute.	1
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.	4
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.	0
Hey! Me too!	2
Ok, you can do this.	0
It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.	0
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.	0
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.	3
All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.	4
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!	2
Really?  My God, he's really cute.	2
Go for it.	0
Phoebe, I'm engaged!	2
I'm just saying, get his number just in case.	0
But no: Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.	0
I did, but that was really fun.	1
Hey.	0
Chandler. I sensed it was you.	0
What?!	2
Unagi. I'm always aware.	0
What's up?	0
I can't figure out what to make Monica.	0
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?	5
Y'know what?	0
She'd-she'd love this.	0
I made it in the sixth grade.	0
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.	0
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.	0
Why not?	0
Yeah, see ya.	0
Hey, thank you so much.	1
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.	0
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!	4
He might still show up.	0
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.	4
Is that all?	0
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?	3
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.	0
Um, it's going to be a small ceremony.	0
Uh, tiny!	2
We're not even sure why we're having it.	0
It's actually going to be just family.	0
Oh wait you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing	2
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.	0
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.	1
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?	1
Well, I brought the next best thing.	0
Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.	2
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!	1
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!	1
You're so sweet!	1
Ohh, you're so sweet!	1
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.	2
Huh.	0
Uhh .	0
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?	4
Nah.	0
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!	5
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!	2
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!	4
No!	4
Do you like car games?	0
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?	0
I	0
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!	1
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?	0
Now, have you told anyone else?	0
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.	0
You told me.	2
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.	2
Me too.	0
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
Oh all right.	0
Yeah, coffeehouse.	0
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.	0
Oh well, we don't because we got the other pl-place.	0

You slept with the stripper?	2
What difference does that make?!	4
Joey, do you have a minute?	0
Dude, what am I gonna	5
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!	5
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.	0
What-what is it, what is it?	0
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.	2
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?	2
I'm not listening to you!	4
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!	1
All right, what are we havin'?	0
Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.	0
I'll take those to go.  For the kids.	0
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?	0
But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.	0
Understood. So, what'd you say back then?	0
Well, I said that I	0
Ha!	0
So you like the drums!	1
That's, that's great!	1
Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.	0
So, yay!	1
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...	0
Tequila!!	1
That's fun.	1
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?	2
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.	3
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.	4
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.	5
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.	4
All right that's it, school is in session!	0
My God! Is this a gym card?	2
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.	0
So why don't you quit?	0
Who is Maria?	0
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym treat.	1
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?	0
No!	4
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?	0
Oh no, you'll have to come.	5
Thanks.	0
Thank you.  Mon?	0
Hmm?	0
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.	0
Anybody gonna eat that?	0
Pheebs!	1
Hey!	1
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?	0
Well, when Jake did it I saw that he was wearing women's underwear!	2
I know. They were mine.	0
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.	0
I'm wearing his briefs right now.	0
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.	1
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.	0
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.	1
Lusts of the flesh.	0
What?	0
I don't know.  A cowboy theme?	0
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?	0
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it’s beautiful I love it!	1
Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.	0
Hey!	1
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?	0
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my  breast?	0
It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen.	0
Yowsa!	2
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.	0
I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?	0
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that...	0
Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?	0
She looks scared.	0
Doesn’t she  look scared?	0
Y’know, I don’t really know her.	0
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?	0
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.	0
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?	0
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."	0
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.	0
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.	4
Pathetic mess?	0
I know, but-come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.	0
I'm thinkin', cha-ching!	1
Thanks.	0
Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.	0
You're doin' this.	0
Hi. She said yes.	0
Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?	1
"Happy birthday to you!"	1
You're paying for that.	0
What? No-no it's her birthday!	2
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!	2
But it really	0
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.	0
Damnit!	4
Rach? Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?	0
Well yeah	0
Oh wow!	2
I mean, wow!	2
Really?!	2
Oh so-so not really never.	0
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.	0
I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.	0
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.	0
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.	5
Well I only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.	0
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!	3
Chandler?	0
I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.	0
I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk.	3
Hang-hang on.	0
Hey everybody!	0
Uh, I'm gonna kill myself!	3
I'll get back to ya.	0
I got nothing.	0
Wait.	0
Uh, hey Marge!	0
Ehh, nothing.	0
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!	2
I didn't know he could get me fired!	2
What am I going to do?	5
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.	0
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.	5
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!	0
That's not a bad idea.	0
Yeah.	0
Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.	0
Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.	1
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?	0
Yeah, you wish.	0
Whoa-whoa, what is it?	2
Well  It's a date.	0
A date?!	2
No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!	2
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.	3
No, I'm gonna!!	4
That's right!	4
Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl!	4
Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!	4
And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!	4
That-It's not the same thing! This is	4
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!	4

Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.	1
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.	0
Oh God.	2
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?	0
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'	5
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.	0
Hey!	2
Hey.	0
So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.	0
No, I can spot you from here.	0
What?	2
Okay, listen Robert...	0
I don't have time for this.	4
No, that is what the game is.	0
Which you just gave up really quickly.	0
Have you seen Joey?	0
What's the matter?	0
Oh, just this!  Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we	0
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.	0
What's going on?	2
He's retiling my floor.	0
He started mine first!	4
Can I help you?	0
Uh-oh.	5
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.	0
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.	0
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.	0
Well ah, ........y'know.	0

We'll be there.	1
Great. I'll ah, see ya then.	1
All right, rock on.	1
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great.	1
Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.	3
Yeah, well.	0
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?	0
Oh yeah, I'd love that.	1
Oh, great! Me too.	1
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.	0
And why do you care so much?	0
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!	1
No! Y'know,	0
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?	0
Ahh.	0
Do you love her?	0
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?	0
You love her!	2
What-what is love really?	0
Ohhh, I	0
I am a good kisser.	0
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in   I've been watching too much porn.	0
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.	0
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I	1

Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.	1

Ohh  I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?	1
Not	0
No! I'm so happy for them!	1
Me too! So happy for them!	1
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.	0
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?	0
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.	0
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?	0
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.	0
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.	1
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence  dozens of people.	1
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?	4
Yay!!	1
Oh, in that case--Yay!  That was me hopping on board.	1
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?	1
Hello.	0
Hey, it's me.	0
I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone.	3
All I	0
Hello.	0
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm	5
Stop callin'!!	4
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.	1
All right!	0
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything	0
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!	0
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.	0
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!	2
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!	4
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.	0
I don't accept this rule.	4
When we make plans, I expect you to show up.	4
Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better!	4
Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!	4
Did you know he was in there?	0
No.	0
How long have we been home?	0
About a half an hour.	0
Love	0
Lights.  Uh, romantic lights.	0
Ooh, nice.	1
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.	0
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.	0
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life	0
Yeah?	0
Wow.	2
There's one thing missing.	3
What's that?	0
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.	0
Okay.	0
Monica, I want to become  the Ultimate Fighting Champion.	0
You wanna what?!	2
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!	1
What are you talking about?	2
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.	0
Yeah.	0
Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.	1
I want you close enough to smell the blood.	1
What do you think?	0
Okay to come in?	0
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.	0
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?	0
What?!	2
Really?	2
When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!	3
Chandler!	2
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor "	3
There was just one woman, wasn't there?	0
No, there were two.	0
Including me?	2
Oh yeah.	1
Hey!	1
Welcome back!	1
Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?	1
I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon.	0
Why?	2
Uh, the sex.	0
What sex?	2
We didn't have sex.	2
Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.	2
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.	3
I'm your mother.	0
Ehh?	2
Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler...	0
Hi there.	0
...and he couldn't let it go, and... I don't really know what happened with that either.	0
Oh-oh!	2
And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.	0
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don't know what happened there either...	0
Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.	0
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?	0
Well yeah, I lied before.	3
Oh!	2
Oh God	2
Now you know how you really feel about it.	0
Oh-oh, that's a risky little game!	2
Are you really gonna do this?	5
Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby!	1
With who?	0
Ah, it's still not the time.	0
You said I was boring--Ohh!	4
When did I say you were boring?!	0
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!	2
Phoebe! You and I have	0
Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake?	0
Okay, there's a	0
All right, I'm leaving!	4
Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move.	4
That's you Rachel!	4
Yeah, I got that.	0
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?	4
You take care Jill.	0
Bye.	0
I-I can't believe Jill's gone.  I can't help it, I opened a gate.	3
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!	4
Hey, how are you guys doing?	0
Great! Monica's moving!	1
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!	2
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys	0
No Phoebe I am mad!	4
Well, deep-deep-deep down!	0
Yeah, I'm just mad!	4
Then keep running.	0
Okay!	0
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.	0
Oh great!  Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.	1
Yeah?	0
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?	0
No.	0
I'm sorry.	0
It's just 'cause I couldn't be there.	0
'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.	3
Sorry.	0
What happened?	0
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.	0
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!	1
Well	0
I just didn't see the fast song coming.	2
Shh.	0
Shh.	0
Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay.	0
Oh, thank you.	0
That is so sweet!	1
Yeah.	0
Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself.	0
It's Joey right?	0
Yeah.	0
Wait a minute!	2
No!	4
I'm the nice one!	2
I'm the one who danced with the kids all night!	2
How How small are your feet?	0
!	2
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.	0
You mean Dr. Geller?	0
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.	2
Oh, he won't sit here.	0
Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.	0
Okay.	0
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.	3
Oh yeah man.  Joey.	0
Hey.	0
Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it.	0
Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay.	0
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	0
I should uh, probably go.	0
I forgot my purse.	0
Oh.	0
No, I really did forget my purse.	0
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.	0
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.	1
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.	0
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?	0
....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?	2
I spelled out boobies.	1
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?	0
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.	0
What?	2
No.	3
It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool.	5
So, how many have you sold so far?	0
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!	2
Oh my God, how did you do that?	2
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!	1
That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.	1
I am selling cookies by the case.	1
They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'	1
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....	0
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?	2
Me! On my computer.	1
Like an eclipse.	0
Hi.	0
Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?	2
Why not? It's built into the price of the room.	0
Yeah but you don't need--What is this?	2
Thread!	1
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?	1
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?	2
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said	2
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.	0
And then you said, "Why do they call it a check?	0
Why not a Yugoslavian?"	0
Yeah, then you did that.	0
So you don't have the cameras?!	2
No. Sorry man.	3
Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.	0
In-in three minutes.	0
Uhh, Rachel, my parents	0
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you.  Hello.	1
Hi.	0
Hello.	0
What?	2
See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually.	0
It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at	0
Maybe in L.A?	0
Yes!	1
There you go.	0
So, have you kids eaten yet?	0
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.	0
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?	0
Oh, yeah, well  Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.	0
So  We go eat.	0
Yes.	0
You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.	0

All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.	0
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.	4
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.	0
Either, it makes no difference.	0

You got Rachel pregnant?!	2
Who did?!	2
You did!	4
Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.	5
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you? Nothing?	4
No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.	5
What?!	2
Oh really? That's how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?	4
Hey! I offered to marry her!	4

Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.	0
All right, bye-bye.	0
Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.	0
We'll give you Janice.	0
I miss Janice though.  "Hello, Chandler Bing."	0
"Oh, my, god."	2
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"	1
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.	0
We won. We won!	1
Mr. Heckles.	0
How did this happen?	0
He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand.	0
I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me.	0
Sure, you coulda. You never know.	0
You never know.	0
Oh, I'm sorry.	3
Where's Chandler?	0
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.	0
I'm free! I'm free!	1
That oughta do it.	0
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?	2
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.	0
I didn't know there were docks.	2
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
Aww, is it broken?	3
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?	0
What is this? Fruit?	2
Monica's making jam.	0
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?	1
Because the kids need new shoes.	0
I'm going into business people.	0
What's the opposite of man?	0
Jam.	0
Oh Joey don't!	5
This will just be my batch.	0
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?	2
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.	0
What? Mine aren't tinted.	2
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?	0
I will have one.	0
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.	0
Neither will I.	0
All right I'll have one.	0
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.	0
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.	5
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.	0
Why? Why can't you go to him?	2
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.	1
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!	2
And all these people actually died?	2
That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!	0
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.	0
It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.	0
Hello?	2
Ross.	0
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.	3
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.	1
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.	3
So, let's go.	0
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.	0
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.	0
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.	0
Okay, I've got three of my five.	0
Three of your five, what?	0
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.	0
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.	2
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.	0
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?	0
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....	1
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.	2
Susan Sarandon.	0
And!! Isabella Rosselini.	1
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.	1
So?	0
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.	0
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.	0
Y'know what I think it is?	0
I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.	0
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.	0
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.	0
What?	2
Ten centimeters, you're about to become a mom.	0
My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!	2
Are they here yet?	0
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?	0
Ok.	0
Hi.	0
May I see your boarding pass?	0
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.	0
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.	0
No, I know, but I-he just went on.	0
No no no! Federal regulations!	4
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is	0
Alright. What's the message?	0
Uh... I don't know.	0
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.	0
What?	0
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.	0
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!	2
There's no Rachel!	4
Here's the thing, Janice.	0
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.	0
You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.	0
Ow!	2
Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?	2
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.	0
I'm fine.	0
All right.	0
I'm not fine. Here she comes.	5
Wait here. Breathe.	0
How do you do that?	2
It's like a gift.	0
We should always always break up together.	0
Oh, I'd like that.	0
Well, what did you have?	0
That my friend is D-Cup.	0
Okay, now much have you won so far?	0
Uh,  wow, 700.	2
Not 700 exactly?	2
Yeah.	0
What?	2
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.	0
Really?	2
Hey, I didn't make up the rules.	0
Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.	0
Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.	0
Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!	2
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.	3
Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!	1

Intense and creepy.	0
Hello.	0
Hi.	0
Yeah. Right.	0
Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?	1
Okay.	0
I can't believe we're here.	1
Oh you've got to be kidding me.	2
What?	2
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.	0
No!! You have been screwing us all day!	4
Who are you?	2
I mean we should get free stuff too!	4
Well you can have the suite if you want.	0
We don't care about where we stay.	0
We need the stuff.	0
Yes!	1
Okay, well then how about a handshake?	0
I did not mean to touch that-I mean	5
Hey Pheebs!	1
Hey!	1
Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!	1
which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of dominance.	0
Okay, that-that's all for today.	0
Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?	0
Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.	0
What?! That-that's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.	2

I can't do this.	3
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?	3
I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.	3
Ahh!	2
Y'know?	0
Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you.	0
Really?	2
No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.	0
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.	3
That's okay.	0
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.	0

We have. Maybe we'll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o'clock?	0
Well, maybe we will.  Oh!	1
Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.	0
You have chalk on your face.	0
Cool!!	1
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.	0
Hi.	0
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale.	0
If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.	0

I highly doubt that.	4
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?	5
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.	0
Aw!	2

You should ah, you should just leave it.	0
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.	4
Eh! There you go.	0

Hi.	0
Hey!	1

Hey, Joey!	1
Hey!	1
Ooh!	1
Ooh!	1
And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.	1
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?	0
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.	1
So you're not homesick yet?	2
No, I don't think so.	0

Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.	0
You don't say!	2
Good luck, babe.	1
JOEY!!!!!!	1

Without me?!	2
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.	2
Yeah.	0
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!	2
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.	2
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.	4
Can't do it, can you?	0
So I'm thinking about you. So what?	0

More than jewelry.	0
Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.	0

Not her.	0
Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them.	0
Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun.	0
But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown.	0
Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's	0
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?	0
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know?	0
She lives so close.	0
And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny.	0
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?	1
Oh here's a whole bunch.	0
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl."	0
Y'know?	0
Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.	3
Oh my God!	2
What?	2
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant.  So I guess she won't be totally alone.	2
Hi.	0
Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger.	3
Now, this is just a loan.	0
Okay?	0
I'm gonna, I'm gonna want him back.	0
So   I'm gonna go now.	0
I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!	3
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Hi!	1
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.	0
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do.	0
Wait, now, what am I doing again?	2
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!	4
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.	0
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.	4
So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay,  but the rest of us have a	3
How do I look?	0
Oh, uh, I... don't... care.	0
Ok, now, remember, no trading.	0
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.	0
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.	1
...And what did you bring?	0
She's checking the coats.	0
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.	0
Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.	0
Janice?	2
Oh.... my.... God.	2
Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!	0
What was that?!	2
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?	0
I haven't seen it yet!	0
Noooooooo!!	4
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!	1
Uh, okay, Pheebs?	0
Yeah?	0
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?	0
Yeah?	0
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!	1
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!	1
Yeah, all of us! All day!	1
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!!	2
Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!	2
Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!	4
Is she in there?	0
Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her.	0
Oh it's all right.	0
I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing.	3
It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different.	3
This is hard.	3
Yeah I know.	0
On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with.	0
Just wait.	0
Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.	1
You have no idea.	1
Thanks sweetie.	0
You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?	0
Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.	3
Oh you did, there are twenty in here.	0
Right. Good night.	0
Good night.	0
Hi	0
Hi!  Hey mom.	1
This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?	1
Jack?	2
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?	2
That's a good question, dad. That's a good question	0
Hmmm .	0
Congratulations you two!	1
Thank you we're so excited	1
And also, congratulations on your wedding.	1
Wha-What?	2
Get out of the way jackass!	4
That	0
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.	2
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!	2
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.	0
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.	0
Oh my God! Oh my God!	2
Ah well, this is the living room.	0
Impressive.	0
All right. This is the kitchen.	0
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical...  bedroom.	0
We're still on this side of the door.	0
Um-hmm.	0
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.	3
Oh shoot! Maybe next time.  Thanks for a lovely evening.	0
Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.	0
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.	0
Well, you seem fine.	0
Well, I don't think this, y'know.	0
Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it.	0
Oh, this will be so much fun!	1
Hey!	2
Are you excited?	1
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?	0
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.	0
All I have is, is oregano and a	0
Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.	1
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.	0
Can we just start throwing things in?	0
Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK.	0
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.	0
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.	0
Hey he's wearing a sweater.	2
No.	0
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.	0
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...	0
Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?	0
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.	3
Oh, it's okay.	0
Y'know what?	0
Let me get it out before it sets.	0
Ooh, I have something you can wear.	0
Here.	0
No-no that's a man's shirt.	0
It's awfully pink.	0
Oh, it's perfect!	1
How about you?	0
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.	0
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.	0
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?	2
Hey!	1
Let's get the show on it!	1
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.	0
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.	0
Closer than here?	0
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.	0
Okay, your highness.	0
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry.  That's okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!	2
So how did you know I was even here?	2
Your mom called me. So is this her?	0
No, this is a loaner.	0
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.	0
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?	0
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.	0
Yeah, they're not so bad.	0
I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm	0
All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.	5
I just called a friend of mine.	0
Yeah?	2
I think I may be able to book	0
Really?!	2
There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.	3
What?!	2
I'm sorry daddy.	3
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.	5
Stay calm?!!	4
How do you expect me to stay calm?!	4
This is unacceptable Rachel!	4
And I wanna know why?!!	4
Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?!	4
Is that it?	4
Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.	3
So, you're like a zillionaire?	2
And you're our age. You're our age.	2
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.	0
What like Pete Dakota?	0
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.	0
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.	0
That's not a state Joe.	0
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?	0
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.	0
Okay.	0
You're our age!	2
So ah, we on for tomorrow?	0
Absolutely!	1
Now get out of here you!!	1
Look, is there something wrong with me?	3
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future?	3
Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on!	3
I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?	3
!	0
No.	0
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.	0
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, 'Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,' remember?	0
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?	0
You know what else I'm not gonna miss?	4
"I'm Monica.	4
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.	4
Even if people are on it!"	4
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"	4
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"	4
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"	4
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend!	4
So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"	4
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.	0
Item J437-A, color: winterberry.	0
Hi umm, listen come here, come in.	0
I'm so-so sorry about yesterday.	3
I-I'm really sorry.	3
Listen Ross, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.	0
You do?	2
And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.	1
And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can't.	3
It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just  It just wasn't meant to be.	3
Ross, we we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?	3
No.	0
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.	0
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.	0
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.	0
Gimme this.	0
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.	0
Brides magazines?	2
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.	0
Oh my God.	2
I know.  I need more pie.	0
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?	0
You didn't break up with that fireman?	2
No, that was my way of telling you.	0
Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.	0
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.	0
Wow!	2
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.	0
So then, are you going to dump Jason?	0
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and  Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so's Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?	0
So  It's really just about the math.	0
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.	0
Ok, look! Enough is enough!	4
Monica, that was also true an	0
But...	0
You knew this about me when you married me!	0
You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.	0
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.	0
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.	0
Yeah me too, all night.	0
Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?	2
Yeah well that's because uh I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.	0
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!	2
Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker	2
Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.	0
So.	0
So.	0
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.	0
I mean, you know, we've never really talked.	0
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?	0
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.	5
Really? Me?	2
Yes.	0
Oh my god, are you kidding?	2
Well, you're not totally paranoid.	0
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?	0
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.	1
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.	0
All right, Julie.	0
Bye.	0
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.	1
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.	0
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!	4
What?	2
They put you in jail?	2
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!	4
Maybe it was the guy.	0
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?	0
Well, if you want, I'll just-I'll just break it off with her.	0
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.	0
Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.	0
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..	2
We can, we can go to Aruba!	1
When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.	3
You would've liked it.	3
I had a bra.	0
Hey, Dr. Farber.	0
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.	0
What?!	2
Oh my God! What does	2
Oh that's an eye removal machine.	0
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!	1
Almost! But first, we gotta start.	0
Okay.	0
This is a glaucoma test.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Sit down.	0
Okay.	0
But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.	0
What?!	2
Sure, now I'm scared.	5
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.	0
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!	5
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!	1
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.	0
Oh, hey.	0
Hi.	0
Hey.	0
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.	0
Hey!	2
Hey!	2
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.	0
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.	0
You're building a post office?	2
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.	0
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.	2
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.	0
Power saw kinda got away from me there.	0
Hi!	1
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?	0
I can't seem to say goodbye.	3
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?	2
It was cheesecake.	0
It was fine.	0
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling   Wow!	2
My whole mouth just filled with saliva!	1
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.	0
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?	0
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.	0
This one's from me.	0
Ahh!	2
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.	0
A scooter!	2
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.	0
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.	1
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!	1
Okay.	0
For my last birthday you gave me a	0
Okay.	0
Happy birthday Grandma!	1
It's better to be over the hill  then buried under it.	0
All our love Monica and Chandler.	0
That's funny, yeah!	1
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!	2
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!	1
That's why it's so funny.	0
Hey, Joey. What's going on?	0
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.	0
Hello, Joey.	0
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?	2
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...	1
Really?	2
Hey, buddy.	0
Hi.	0
Oh, that's attractive.	0
Oh, ah- the kid has it.	0
The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.	4

Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?	0
What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!	2
Hi!	1
I'm so glad you could make it.	1
She's still mad.	0
Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.	1
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?	2
Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.	0
Julie's cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that's about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.	1
Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?	0
Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare.	0
Am I interrupting?	0
Uh yes! Thank you.	1
Oh. Oh wait no.	0
Later.	0
Oh uh, I'm sorry.	0
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!	5
Try feeding her again.	0
I already fed her.	0
Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants.	5
Hey.	0
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.	3
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.	3
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.	0
You al-you already had it?	2
Yeah.	0
Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.	0
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.	3
We ruined everything.	3
Ugh	3
No, what did, that was really sweet.	1
And it kinda works out for the best.	1
What do you, what do you mean?	2
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!	1
I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don't even like!	1
Monica.	0
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.	0
Not you guys.	0
You got it going on!	1
So, what are we gonna do today?	0
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.	0
Why not?	0
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!	0
Oh,	0
I punched you...?	2
And...?	2
... Phoebe...?	2
... and...?	0
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.	3
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.	0
Yeah.	0
Hey!	2
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.	3
What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!	2
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.	0
All right. Did everyone get out okay?	5
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.	0
Ohh. What is this?	2
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!	5
Hey.	0
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?	0
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.	0
Hot dog?	0
Four, please.  I'm really nervous.  Thank you.	5
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?	0
What?	0
Oh!	2
I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.	1
Ohh, that's too bad!	3
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.	0
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?	0
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.	0
Hey, the fight's starting!	1
Okay, we'll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?	0
Okay, I had to put on lotion!	0
But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.	0
Fight's over!	0
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?	0
Hey!	0
Hey!	0
What are you up too?	0
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites.	0
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.	0
Yeah, Big Brother.	0
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.	0
Yeah, well  Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?	0
Eh	0
Okay well that's good to know.	3
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!	1
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.	1
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.	0
My friend's name is Joey.	0
Apparently Howie's editing now.	0
Can you believe that?!	2
Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!	2
Refill?	0
Good! Good, long time no see.	1
Yeah.	0
Like your sweater.	0
Oh hey, right back at ya.	0
Oh, it's crazy about Rachel huh?	2
Yeah. She-Well, she's one crazy lady?	2
So whose is it?	0
Umm, I don't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.	0
Okay.	0
You wanna fool around with Joey?	2
Yeah!	1
You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!	1
And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!	2
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?	2
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.	0
Who, who are they?	0
I know them from work.	0
Both of them?	2
No, one of them...	0
Which one?	0
I don't know, what were the names I just said?	0
All right, all right, you're right	3
What the hell are you cooking!	2
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!	2
Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?	2
How do you know?	5
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!	4
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.	0
There's a reset button?!	2
Ugh, thank you!	1
Thank you!	1
There's a reset button!	2
My God!	2
Why didn't I see that!	2
Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?	0
Oh here it is!	1
Oh!	2
Ohh, God!	1
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".	0
Ring dammit, ring!	4
Thanks.	0
Hey, you know our phone's not working?	2
What?!	2
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.	0
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!	4
Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.	0
Nngghhh!!!!!!!	4
Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.	0
"Heating device."	0
Radiator.	0
Five letters.	0
Rdtor.	0
Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.	2
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.	0
Well, how long do you think it'll be?	0
Any minute now.	0
Hey.	0
Hey! Any good mail?	0
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.	0
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda .	0
"Benefits lapsed."	0
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.	0
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.	0
Let me see that!	2
All right.	0
Oh, I can't believe this!	2
This sucks!	4
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.	0
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!	2
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.	1
Y'know what else I can't believe?	0
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.	0
Do you know anything about women?	0
No.	0
That's all right.	0
Okay.	0
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.	1
Yeah. He could row like a viking.	1
Hi.	0
Mmm.	0
So how'd it go?	0
Oh, y'know..	0
Did he mention us?	0
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.	3
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.	3
...love you.	1
Are you're hands still wet?	0
Let's dry 'em again.	0
Still crying?	2
Like a	0
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.	0
What's the other one?	0
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one.	0
I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.	0
You're the talker.	0
Anyway uh, great idea!	1
Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.	0
Oh, we have some	0
Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.	0
Great!	1
Yeah, what town are we near?	0
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?	0
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.	0
Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?	0
Okay.	0
Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?	0
Okay!	0
Yeah, no they don't do that.	0
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?	5
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.	0
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!	4
But if...	5
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.	4
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.	1
I'm telling you man, I saw it.	0
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.	4
I know.	0
Let's try a look of far off wonderment.	0
Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come.	1
Chandler!	2
What is the matter with your face?!	2
Don't laugh at him!	4
He's	0
Aww!	1
We're gonna find love!	1
Definitely!	1
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.	0
That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!	1
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.	0
What do you mean?	0
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.	0
You mean a backup?	0
Exactly!	1
Yeah, yeah I got that.	0
You do?	0
Hm-mmm.	0
Who?	0
Joey.	0
Joey?!	2
Yeah!	1
Are you serious?!	2
Wh  So  If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.	2
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.	0
Oh, seriously?	2
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?	0
Yeah, I'm sorry man.  You wanna go watch?	0
Yeah!	1
Good morning.	0
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.	1
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!	1
Well kinda old, like 30.	0
Oh.	0
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.	2
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?	2
A little.	0
Yeah?	2
How you doin'?	0
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!	1
I know.	0
What did you just say?	2
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.	1
Are you serious?!	2
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.	1
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.	1
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!	1
Whoa!	1
Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas.	0
I guess it must've been some movie I saw.	0
What do you say?	0
Okay!	1
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!	1
It went under the table.	0
All right!	1
Here it is! Here it is!	1
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.	0
It's a four.	0
I think so too.	0
Well that's it. I'm done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.	1
Well Joey, we're all we're all very proud of you.	1
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.	0
Is there anything we can do for you?	0
No just, nobody press on my stomach.	0
You can keep those pants by the way.	0
Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?	2
Yeah, you want some?	0
Ah, just cut me a little sliver.	1
A little bigger.	0
Little bigger.	0
What?!	2
Cut me a real piece!	4
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?	2
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.	0
Oh my God!	2
Of course, of course.	0
Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?	0
Umm, do you know each other's hometowns?	0
Well, umm, not much.	0
But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know?	0
So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?	0
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?	0
Nothing-Why?!	0
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!	4
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.	0
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?	4
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?	0
Okay,  I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you.	5
Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.	3
Your good heart Rach,  and, and....	3
No.	0
I can't, you're a totally different person to me now.	3
I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.	3
It's just changed, everything.	3
Forever.	3
Then how come it is?	3
Windows are clean, candels are lit.	0
Did I turn the fish?	0
No, cause I made lasagne.	0
Just a touch.	0
I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?	2
I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.	2
What?	0
I don't know.	0
You don't plan these things.	0
So, did you shave your legs?	0
Yeah.	0
A-ha!	2
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.	0
Hi!	1
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.	0
Uh-oh.	5
But that's okay, no problem.	0
No problem.	0
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."	0
Oh, what did I say?	2
Hmm, noodle soup.	0
How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!	2
All right, let's try one.	0
Hmm, noodle soup.	0
Okay. Let's do it again.	0
Okay.	0
COME ON!!!!	4
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!	4
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!	0
Yeah?	0
Give her some money.	0
I really think they're out of rooms.	0
They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!	4
Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are.	0
Okay.	0
Uh, say would you umm  Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?	0
This is a hospital.	0
Okay.	0
Y'know what?	0
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa!	4
Oh gosh!	2
Whoa!	2
What-what?	2
Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!	2
Would you like to see a semi-private room?	0
Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.	0
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.	0
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.	0
You mean they're lovers.	2
If you wanna put a label on it.	0
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?	2
Okay, quick and painful.	0
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.	5
Oh, what? What-what?	2
Y'know Marcel?	0
...Yeah?	0
Hi Pheebs!	1
Hi!	1
How are ya?	0
Good.	0
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?	0
Yeah.	0
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?	0
Yeah!	1
Ooh, now you lost me.	5
You stole the phone!	4
No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!	5
Phoebe!	4
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?	0
How could I have left them in the copy room?	0
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.	4
Fine.	4
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!	1
This will be your phone.	0
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.	0
No you answer it and take pledges.	0
But I'm the host!	2
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.	0
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.	0
Well, here's your phone doctor.	0
Hey guys.	0
Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?	2
Well, he's very charming.	0
Well, you're just gonna have to try.	0
Joey, where are the	0
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...	0
Phew, close one.	0
Oh!	2
Look what happened!	2
Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up.	3
Hey.	0
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!	1
Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?	2
I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.	1
Yeah, you like that don't you?	0
Oh yeah right there!	1
You want it there? You take it there baby!	1
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?	4
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be!	4
Huh?	0
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!	4
I talk to you and it's nothin'.	0
You look at me, and nothin'.	0
Nothing.	0
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.	1
Well, that was ah...	0
What?! What are you doing?!	2
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.	0
No. We were in the middle of sex and	0
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.	0
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.	0
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?	2
Seriously, it's moving!	2
What the hell is in there?	2
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.	0
I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.	0
Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.	4
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	3
Thank you.	0
Rach?	2
I'll be out in a second.	0
Oh.  It's just so unexpected! I I uh Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a	1
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.	0
in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon.  Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.	0
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.	0
I can't believe you don't want to know.	2
And Monica knows...	0
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!	2
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.	0
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!	1
Or an uncle...	0
Hey Phoebe!	1
Hi Pheebs!	1
Pheebs!	1
Fine!	4
Phoebe, what's the matter?	0
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.	3
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.	0
Fine.	0
Phoebe, what is it?	0
All right, you know Paolo?	0
I'm familiar with his work, yes...	0
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!	2
More coffee over here, please!	1
Hey.	0
Hey. What, what are you doing here?	2
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.	3
Yeah,  oh, but oh...	0
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....	0
Destiny.	0
Sure.	0
Yes.	0
All right.	0
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.	2
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.	0
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.	0
Well, they go into the chipper.	0
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!	5
Hey! Hey!!	2
Light still out?	0
Yeah.	0
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.	0
Shut up!	4
So, whaddya think George is like?	0
I think he's shy.	0
Yeah?	2
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.	0
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean,	1
Aren't you with that girl over there?	0
Well, yeah, kinda.	0
Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I'm allowed to sleep with you.	0
Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast.	5
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...	0
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?	0
Um, yeah.	0
May I see it?	0
Um, no.	5
But, okay.	0
I'm not on the list!	2
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.	0
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.	0
Y'know it's ironic...	0
What?	0
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.	0
We're just gonna be friends.	0
Hey Pheebs!	1
Ohh! You made up!	2
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.	0
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.	1
We have one.	0
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!	2
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?	0
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!	0
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?	0
So that's the only reason she could be here huh?	0
It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a	0
Y'know what?	0
I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later.	0
Good-bye.	0
Whoa!	2
Uh, that was your sister actually.	0
She-she thinks that you're just using me.	0
So?	0
I'm sorry.	3
What are you doing here?!	2
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.	0
What?!	2
Umm, okay, okay, look.	0
Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.	4
So if you can help me find my Father then you should!	4
Otherwise, you're just mean!	4
So, just tell me the truth!	4
My Father is Chuck Magioni?	2
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!	0
And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.	3
Oh.	3
But umm, you're right.	0
I think that a person should know where they come from.	0
Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.	0
I'm your mother.	0
Heh?	2
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...	3
What's happening to your accent?	2
Come again?	2
All right, I'm-I'm not English.	3
I'm from Long Island.	0
I'm sorry.	3
Umm, were there any questions?	0
About paleontology.	0
Where you going, Joe?	0
For a walk.	0
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.	0
Your thoughts? Plural?	2
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!	1
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.	0
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?	0
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.	0
Great novels?	2
Fine ... mediocre porn	0
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.	0
Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.	0
Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,	0
Got it!	1
Let's roll!	1
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?	0
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.	0
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.	0
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?	0
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?	0
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.	0
What?	2
You are iron.	0
You are steel!	1
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?	0
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!	2
Look, you and I went to different high schools...	0
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.	0
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.	0
They had to have that specially made?!	2
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.	0
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!	2
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out.	2
And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.	1
I-I owe her this.	0
I never let her eat.	0
Oh, you go out with him.	0
Oh, really?!	2
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?	0
I'll try.	0
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.	0
Yeah, yeah, okay.	0
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!	4
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know	0
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.	4
Yeah but	3
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.	0
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!	1
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!	1
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?	1
Sure!	1
And Joey?	0
How do you think she's doing?	0
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?	2
Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....	2
Thank you!	1
Now that Rachel's gone?	0
What?	2
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?	3
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.	1
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.	1
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.	0
What do you mean?	2
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working	3
Hey there little fella!	1
Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh?	0
Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!	1
Yay!	1
!	2
Yay!	1
Yay!	1
Y'know?	0
For fun?	0
Like what?	2
Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.	0
Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk?	0
Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.	0
I love that idea!	1
Hey, Sophie!	1
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.	4
Oh my God, they took my idea!	2
That was you?!	2
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.	0
Oh my God, are you guys okay?	2
Are you all right?	2
Oh my.	2
Hi.	0
Oh my gosh, Joshua!	2
All those things I said about not being ready	0
No, they're-they're all true.	0
But	0
Oh! Oh, I love that but.	2
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?	0
Yeah.	0
Okay.  Every time.	0
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.	0
Yes, but, Ross you	0
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.	3
Why would we do that?	2
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.	3
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.	0
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.	2
The balloon?	0
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached	0
I can't, I gotta go.	0
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?	2
Got the keys?	0
Ok.	0
What d'you think?	0
Lotsa things.	0
Which one do you think she is?	0
May I help you?	0
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.	0
You don't observe a dance class. You	0
What does she mean?	0
I think she means  'You	0
She could be you.	0
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...	0
Okay, I'm not getting this!	4
I'm totally getting it!	1
What? You just click when they click.	2
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.	0
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.	0
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.	2
Nooo, it wasn't.	0
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...	1
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.	1
I know	0
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!	1
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!	1
The sun is out!	1
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.	0
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.	0
Nooo!	3
Damn it!	4
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.	0
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?	3
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.	0
Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.	0
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.	0
But it's $2,000.	2
Sorry.	3
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.	0
Hey! How's it goin'?	0
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.	0
Yes it has! I made cookies!	1
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.	0
Okay.	0
Okay, I'll be out in a second.	0
Okay!	0
What are you doing?	0
That doesn't lock does it?	0
That saves us a conversation.	0
Me too, we should get goin'.	0
No.	0
Oh. Mine does.	0
Okay, here comes another camera.	0
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.	0
Why do they keep doing that?	0
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms.	0
They've been taping those people up there all day.	0
Right.	0
Yeah!	1
Hey! You're a good dancer!	2
Really?	2
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.	0
What do you mean?	0
Like this.	0
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.	0
Uh-huh.	0
I don't see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!	0
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!	0
What are you doing here?	0
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?	0
We got some	0
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.	0
Who?  Is that your sister?	2
Ugh, she	0
You suck!!	4
What?!	4
Okay, break-up's still on!	4
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.	3
No, I don't want to hit you.	0
No.	0
My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?	2
Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.	0
Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.	0
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.	0

Well, like father, like son.	0
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.	1
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.	2
Ummmmmmmm, no.	0
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.	0
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.	2
Instead of...?	2
That's right.	0
Never had that dream.	0
No.	0
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.	0
And they weren't looking at you before?!	2
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it,	0
Honey! Dinner's ready!	1
What's my little chef got for me tonight?	1
Your favorite!	1

Yep! And lot's of it!	1
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.	1

Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.	0
Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?	0
Oh my god.	2
What?	2
Come on, they're close.	0
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.	0
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...	0
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.	0
Oh!	2
Ow!	2
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.	0
Really?	2
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.	0
Hello! One marriage please!	1
Yep, we wanna get married!	1
All right.	0
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!	1

Are you sure you wanna do this?	0
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!	1
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!	1
Wait!  Okay!	0
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?	0
It depends on who asked.	0
What if I asked?	0
Oh, Mon, sure.	0
Really?	2
Yes.  You're not asking are you?	2
No.	0
Yes! Totally!	1
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!	1

He asked you out?!	2
Saucy!	1
What are these?	0
Electrical plans for the building.	0
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?	5
I know that switch does something, okay?	0
So-so I went down to city hall and got these.	0
Wow! If only more people knew.	2
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in	0
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.	0
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.	0
Oh, nobody's judging you.	0
Oh man!	2
I want that place so much!!	1
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.	0
Bye!	0
Bye!	0

Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?	0
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!	2
Are you serious?	2
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.	5
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.	0
No, let's just leave the lights on.	0
Oh my God!	2
Oh fine.	0
Ready?  Wrestle!	1
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.	0
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.	0
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!	5
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke.	0

Oh! Ohh! Oh!!	2
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?	0
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!	2
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!	2
Yes. Yes.	0
You?!  And-and you?!	2
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!	1
How?! When?!	2
It happened in London.	0
IN LONDON!!!	2
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.	0
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!	5
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.	5
I know, it's great!	1
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.	0
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?	0
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.	0
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?	0
Ahh!	2
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?	5
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.	0
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?	2
You got a better idea?	0
All right, call it in the air.	0
Heads.	0
Heads it is.	0
Yes! Whew!	1
We have to assign heads to something.	0
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.	0
Okay, some tricks of the trade.	0
Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.	0
Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil.	0
That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it'  Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.	0
And that's how it's done.	0
Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.	1
Hey, Mr. Trib.	0
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.	0
Who are you?	2
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.	0
I'm Chandler's new roommate.	2
I-I-I don't think so.	2
I could be Chandler's new roommate.	2
But, he told me over the phone.	2
He told me in person.	0
That's weird.	2
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh!	1
Hey! Look who I found!	2
Oh, hey guys!	1
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.	0
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.	0
Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas?	0
Didn't think so!	0
Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!	0
Hmm, how about my azzz?	0
Hey, this is hollow.	0
What?	2
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!	2
No, don't look directly at them!	5
What?	2
Alright, no, we could look at them!	0
I	0
Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father.	0
I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.	0
Okay, what's up?	0
I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.	0
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?	2
This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.	1
Mom no, come on! Thank you.	2
Just hear me out!	5
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus.	3
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross.	3
You're, you're really, you're so good.	3
Thanks.	3
And you're so sweet.  And you're kind	0
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.	2

I	0
Philadelphia.	0
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.	2
Really?	2
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.	0
Yeah-yeah.	0
Did you hear that?!	0
Because the universe cares!	1
The whole universe!	1
I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.	3
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you.	0
This is a freaky place.	5
Oh no, it's you.	0
Yeah.	0
I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."	1
They can't all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.	1
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?	2
Do you really want to pull at that thread?	2
I'm having a really good time!	1
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.	0
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?	5
Yeah, I  Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.	3
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!	2
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.	0
Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?	0
Yeah?	0
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?	0
What?! No!	2
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.	0
Look, I don't think so Pheebs.  All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.	0
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?	0
I'll take sports.	0
All right. Uhh, international.	0
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say	0
All right, hold on!	0
Hold on.	0
Hold on.	0
This is Ross, okay?	0
He's our friend.	0
So are you actually gonna see her again?	0
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!	4
I	0
Damnit Phoebe!!	4
Hey, don't we have to...	0
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.	0
Why does this keep happening to me?	4
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.	2
Look, I just lost my other job.	3
Okay?	0
You have no idea how much I need this.	3
Please, help me out, for old times sake.	3
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.	3
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.	1
Good morning.  Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?	0
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!	1
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.	4
Well you did pull his hair.	0
He took my snack!	4
I'm not getting into this again!	4
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.	4
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?	4
That is true.	0
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.	0
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.	0
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.	0
I think that's gum.	0
I'm pretty sure it's gun.	0
That was the only way I could get him to	0
Hi! How are the Gellers?	0
Don't call us that!	4
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?	4
Hey sweetie!	1
Hey!	1
There's no back to this couch!	2
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.	2
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know?	0
Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.	0
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.	1
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.	0
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.	0
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.	0
Yeah?	0
What kind of father do you think I am?	4
All right, sorry.	0
I gotta go make a fake Ben.	0
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!	2
Well, either that or uh	0
Yeah?	0
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!	1
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!	1
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.	0
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!	1
Sure!	0
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it.	0
I mean, everyone should have a-a	0
Oh my God Ross!!	2
You like it?	1
I	0
Yeah?	0
Hello darlings.	0
And there's daddy!	1
There he is! There he is!	2
Where?	0
Right- where we've been looking all night!	1
He is so cute!	1
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!	1
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the--wowww.	1
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.	1
Yeah, isn't he?	1
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.	1
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.	1
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.	2
Huh. That's nice.	0
and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for	0
Eight whole days.	0
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.	1
Awesome!	1
Yeah?	2
My favorite part was when	0
The Armadillo was actually not so	0
Hey!	1
Oh.	0
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.	2
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!	1
Oh.	0
Oh.	0
Okay, I understand why	0
He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'	0
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo!  I'm okay!! I'm all right!!	1
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.	2
What?	0
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?	2
'Cause you're still into Monica.	0
So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...	0
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.	0
Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?	5
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?	0
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.	0
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.	0
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!	4
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.	0
Oh, thanks, sweetie.	1
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.	1
Really?	2
Yeah.	0
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?	5
No, no, they will. I just... uh...	0
Can't wait.	0
Do I know you?	2
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?	2
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.	0
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.	2
Uh, wait, backstage?	2
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.	0
Ross.	0
Chandler.	0
How are you?	0
Look, you guys wanna meet the group?	0
Come on.	0
So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?	2
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.	4
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.	0
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.	0
Really?	2
He does?	2
Hey, buddy, what's up!	1
Oh, she told you about that, huh.	2
Well, yeah, I have one now and then.	0
Well, yeah, now.	0
Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.	0
Well, okay, thanks!	1
God, he's good.	1
If only he were a woman.	0
Yeah.	0
Hey, Frank.	0
Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't.	0
There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.	0
Hi Frank.	0
Hi, Mrs. Knight.	0
Phoebe's right Frank.	0
I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it.	0
I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.	3
Yeah, but not just that.	0
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less	3
None the less.	0
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.	3
That's right, exactly.	0
Bye-bye.	0
Okay, can I just get my purse?	0
Okay, all right, good.	0
.	0
Oh, look look look.	2
The last candle's about to burn out.	0
10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....	0
Thank you.	0
Thanks.	0
Kinda... spooky without any lights.	5
Bwah-hah-hah!	1
Oh.. oh... oh.	0
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.	0
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?	0
You blew them away!	1
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!	1
I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?	0
I was	2
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!	1
Oh my God!  I'm your	2
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.	0
Could've played	0
Thanks.	0
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.	0
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the	0
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?	0
Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.	0
Nooo!	2
Hello?	0
Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.	0
Green. To the green.	0
I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.	0
To the left, to the left- aww!	0
Ohhh... I'm fine.	0
Hey!	1
What message?	0
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.	0
What?! It's 6 o'clock!	2
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!	5
I went to Ross's!	0
I went to the coffeehouse!	0
I went to any place that they made sandwiches!	0
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.	0
That's what you think.	0
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?	0
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.	0
What was her name?	0
Nesele Toulouse.	0
Nestle Tollhouse	0
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.	0
(grabbing a bag of	0
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?	0
Absolutely!	1
I am so on board!	1
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.	0
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.	0
Tell me about it!	0
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!	1
It does sound appealing.	0
Oh but you could.	0
You can.	0
Absolutely!	1
We can help each other out!	1
We can get--what are those--those patches!	0
We could be like the Patch Sisters!	1
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!	1
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!	1
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.	3
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?	0
Does, um, anyone wanna see?	0
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!	4
Hey, this is so unfair!	4
Oh, why is it unfair?	2
Big deal!	4
Well, I-I could live without it.	0
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.	0
Oh,  "you do, do you"?	4
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.	0
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.	0
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.	4
Awww! Mel Torme died.	3
Joey, that paper's like a year old!	0
Aw! Does that mean the	3
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?	0
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.	0
Probably?	0
Kind of what 'probably' really means.	0
Yeah, uh-huh.	0
Y'know?	0
You gotta take care of yourselves!	0
In	0
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?	0
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.	1
Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?	1
He's a keeper. How are you feeling?	0
Oh, I'm fine.	0
Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone.	0
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.	0
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?	0
Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!	0
I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.	0
Okay.	0
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.	0
Hey. Who's that?	0
New people.	0
What happened to the Disgustingtons?	0
It's not fair Ross we got here first!	4
Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.	0
Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.	0
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?	2
Phoebe?	0
Yeah?	0
Look at that guy by the window, wow!	2
He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.	0
Oh, what is wrong with me lately?	3
I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here.	0
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?	0
Yeah.	0
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.	0
Really?! So this has happened to you?	2
Oh absolutely yeah!	0
Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.	0
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a	0
I don't know what I'm going to do!	5
I called the company that sent and th-they don't care!	4
Hey guys!	1
Hey!	1
Hey	0
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!	1
And the guys from work had a blast.	1
And-and another one had never been to a party before, so	2
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those	0
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.	2
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?	2
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.	1
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!	2
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.	0
Obviously! So, how do we decide?	0
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her	0
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.	0
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction	0
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.	0
Yeah well we should order some food then.	0
That sounds fair.	0
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street	0
Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.	0
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.	0
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.	0
So let's decide on the spending limit	0
Yeah. Uh,  a slice  six dollars?	0
I was thinking more like a hundred.	0
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?	0
Hi, again.	0
Hey!	0
Hey!	0
Thank you soo, much.	1
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.	4
You want some help with that?	0
Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don't!	0
Whoa! Are you okay?	2
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.	2
It's the heat.  And-and the humidity.	0
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.	0
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?	0
Like you wouldn't believe.  Wow! This is a great place.	2
What do you mean?	0
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.	0
Oh!	2
Hey, somebody left their keys.	0
Ooohh, to a Porsche!	2
Transcriber's note: Oh come on!	2
Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind?	2
If I had a Porsche, I'd have the keys surgically attached to my hand!	0
Hey Gunther, these yours?	0
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?	0
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?	0
There's a lost and found?  My shoe!	2
You left a shoe here?!	2
Well, I didn't realize until I got home.	0
I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!	0
Y'know what?	0
I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.	0
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.	0
Great! Thanks.	1
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.	0
We have a good time.	1
We laugh, we play.	1
It's like we're father and son.	1
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.	1
Oh, this is so cute.	1
Oh, I got that for him.	0
My mommies love me. That's clever.	1
Hello?	0
Oh, Hi, Ju--Hi, Jew!	0
Uh huh?	0
Uh huh?	0
Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.	0
See ya then.	0
Bye.	0
Did you just say Hi, Jew?	2
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.	0
Thanks Monica!	1
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.	2
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.	0
Okay!	1
Okay.	0
Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It's for you. It's the fire inspector.	0
Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!	2
No-no, it was the candles.	0
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is   Uhh  Uhh  Okay.	0
Well, I have to go now.	0
Joey proposed to me.	2
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!	2
Well, I-I said yes.	5
What?!	2
It’s... It is bigger than  mine!	2
I know.	0
Well do you love him?	0
Sure.	0
Yeah, I mean whatever.	0
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?	0
Oh my God Monica!	2
I wanna wear this everyday.	1
You look so beautiful.	1
I'm so happy for me.	1
Hello?	0
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.	0
Damnit!	4
Uh, y'know what?	0
I'll tell you who it hurts!	4
It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!	4
That was	0
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?	4
Fine.	0
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I	0
Crap!!	4
I gotta go!	0
Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?	2
No.	0
Me neither! We have to get in!	2
Just act like you belong.	0
Oh my God! Oranges!	2
Shh!  Nice to see you again.	0
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?	0
Yes, of course.	0
I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.	0
Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.	0
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?	1
What?	2
Y'know what?	0
All I really needed was a plan.	0
See I wanna have three kids	0
As I was saying  I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years.	0
I love this plan!	1
I wanna marry this plan!	1
I don't know.	0
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!	4
I don't think you have much choice.	0
Well we'll see!	4
Bye-bye!	0
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?	0
Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .	0
Dad?	0
I'm here!	0
Hey!	2
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.	3
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.	0
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.	0
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.	3
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories	1
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven	0
I used to	0
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.	0
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a	0
Ok, got the vent open.	0
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!	1
Ben, you ready?	0
All right, gimme your foot.	0
Ok, on three, Ben.	0
One, two, three.	0
Ok, That's it, Ben.	0
What do you see?	0
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.	0
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!	2
Wait! You forgot your legs!	2
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.	1
Thank you.	1
Filing system?	0
Oh-oh!	2
You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?	0
It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.	1
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.	0
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.	0
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.	1
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost	1
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.	0
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.	0
Yes, I realize that	0
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.	0
I love working with designers!	1
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?	0
Chandler, you have an assistant right?	0
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!	5
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.	0
I do?	2
Yeah!  All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.	0
Okay.	0
Or not.	0
Where's Chandler?	0
Here I am.	0
How did you know?	2
Hey! What's she doing back here?	2
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!	0
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...	0
What happened in Atlantic City?!	2
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar	0
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?	0
So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.	0
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.	2
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard	1
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.	0
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?	0
Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.	0
I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.	0
And-and then guess what?	0
No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.	0
I'm going to the bathroom.	0
Okay.	0
Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.	0
It	0
Hey!	1
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.	0
Not if you were here.	0
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.	0
Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it's you!	1
I hope it's you.	0
Me too!	1
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.	0
Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine	0
Yes!!! Oh!!	1
Still.	0
If Phoebe were my maid of honor	0
Uh-hmm.	0
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.	0
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.	0
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?	0
Well that's the best part. Umm,	0
Wh-why is that the best part?	2
Because then I don't have to!	1
Well of	0
Yeah that's right.	0
Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!	1
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?	0
It's not just the drum noise.	0
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.	0
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?	2
Maybe on some level.	0
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?	2
No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.	0
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.	1
And, a brownie!	1
Well, half a brownie.	0
Actually, it's just bag.	0
It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so	0
Oh man!	1
This is so great!	1
I actually feel like I'm going on a real date!	1
Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about  there.	0
Uh, so nice place you got here.	0
Foosball, huh?	2
Pizza box.	0
Oh, a subscription to	2
Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.	0
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.	0
Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.	0
Hm-mmm.	0
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?	0
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.	0
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?	4
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.	0
Ha. Ha, ha.	1
What?	0
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.	0
Oh, I beg to differ. The	0
That was	0
Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!	1
Well, not playing raquetball!	2
He forgot to leave his grip size!	2
He didn't get the goggles!	2
Well,sounds like you two have issues.	0
Goodbye, baby.	0
Ciao, bela.	0
Do they wait for me to do this?	0
So are you gonna tell him?	0
Why would I tell him?	0
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.	0
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!	2
...What did I ask?	0
Ross, ten o'clock.	0
No,	0
What?	0
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!	1
Oh. Hel-lo!	1
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!	1
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.	1
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'	5
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!	1
Oh please, could she	0
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.	0
Thank you, buddy.	1
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.	0
You could do that!	1
Y'think?	2
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.	0
OK.	0
This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?	1
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.	0
Last time I do that, I promise.	0
I am so, so, so, so sorry!	3
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
So, are we going in there?	0
I am!!	1
Wow!	2
It actually is in the handbook.	0
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.	0
Wow!	2
What?	2
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.	1
Really?	2
Yeah.	0
Let's also get a hot plate!	1
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends	1
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.	0
I do the same thing.	0
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25	1
I'm just kidding too.  I'm getting married in December.	1
So when are you getting married?	0
Oh May 15	0
Oooh it's getting close!	1
Yeah!	1
So uh, who's your photographer?	0
Jeffery.	0
The best man? Wow!	2
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!	1
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.	0
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!	1
Oh y'know what?	0
Y'know what?	0
Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off.	0
So, does this  come in another color or	0
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.	0
It was unbelievable!	2
We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...	1
So have you called her yet?	0
Let her know I like her?	5
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.	0
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.	2
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.	0
Her answer machine?	0
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.	0
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?	0
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!	2
Okay, okay, what's going on?	0
Okay, they're just talking...	0
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?	0
So, um, what do you do for a living?	0
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.	0
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.	0
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.	3
Now that is funny.	0
Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?	0
'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.	3
I guess.	0
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?	0
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.	0
Come on.	0
These people'll scooch down.	0
You guys'll scooch, won't you?	0
Let's try scooching!	1
Come on.	0
Come on.	0
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.	0
Carol, Kristin.	0
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.	0
Okay.	0
All right.	0
When I was six years old.	0
Hm-mmm.	0
I wanted a big wheel.	0
It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me.	3
That was a pretty tough year.	3
That's-that's great!	1
See?	0
I already feel like I know you a little better!	1
Thank you.	1
Okay, come on.	0
Now we can go eat.	0
Let's go.	0
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.	3
Oh!	2
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?	4
That's patio furniture!	2
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!	0
What about the birds?	0
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."	0
You pick one.	0
All right, how about the ladybugs?	0
Bijan for men?	0
Bijan for men?	0
Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.	0
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.	0
Ready, Annabelle?	0
You bet.  Maybe some other time?	0
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!	3
That was amazing!	1
Phoebe and Gary are	0
That was amazing.	1
We are the hottest! Huh?	1
No, you're the best.	0
No, you're the best.	0
No, you're the best.	0
I	0
Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'?	0
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?	0
How you doin'?	0
So what are you gonna do?	0
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.	3
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.	0
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.	0
Why? What happened to him?	0
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.	0
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.	0
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.	1
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.	0
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.	0
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"	2
Um-hmm, five actually.	0
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?	0
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.	0
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!	2
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?	0
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.	0
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.	0
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.	0
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.	0
So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.	0
No, I'm sorry.	0
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!	2
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?	0
Oh just great.	0
He beeps me now with codes.	0
One is, "Bring me food."	0
Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food."	0
Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."	0
Yeah! She's right in there!	1
Oh great.   Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!	1
Hey!	0
Hey!	0
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!	2
I don't know, clean places?	0
Umm, yum!	0
It's Danny.	0
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.	5
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!	2
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?	0
We have a ladle.	0
Thanks, see you at the party.	0
Okay, great!	1
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."	0
You're so efficient. I love you!	1
Let's go!	1
That'll work!	1
I don't think so.	0
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!	1
Here just take this.	0
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.	0
Okay, one thing at a time.	0
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?	0
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.	1
Oh, that's great.	1
Why are- why are you so tanned?	2
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.	0
Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.	1
Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...	3
Water rules!	1
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?	0
Nope. Going to the	0
No, it is me!	1
Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!	4
I'm- I'm Monana!	1
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.	0
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.	1
What?	0
Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.	0
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?	0
No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!	0
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.	0
I just...	0
I wrote that out phonetically for you.	0
Phonetically?	0
Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.	0
Ok.	0
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!	2
Wow. What does	2
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?	0
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .	0
Come on! you...	0
No!	4
Oh.  Oh-oh.	0
Hey!  What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?	2
Done!	1
Well, I wanted to be thorough.	0
So umm, does it?	0
I'm sorry.	3
Does it?	5
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.	0
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!	4
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even	4
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't	0
I know.	0
You got married again.	0
Yes.	0
So that's your second marriage in two years.	0
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.	0
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.	0
Why don't you tell me what happened.	0
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk	0
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?	2
Oh, that's better then.	0
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.	0
I see. Have you considered therapy?	0
I think just the	0
There are a couple of forms to fill out.	0
Easy.	0
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.	0
No problem.	0
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.	0
Ooh!	2
There's no way to do this without her?	2
'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.	5
Okay.	0
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.	0
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.	0
Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.	0
What?	2
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.	0
That's alright, I'll take it.	0
Bad things happen to me anyway.	0
This way I can break 'em up with a movie.	0
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...	0
Ah!  Huh?	2
You wanna do it right now?	0
Great!	1
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from	0
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from	0
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.	0
You're welcome.	0
is for me not to see you anymore.	3
That's crazy!	2
Oh God.	5
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.	3
And I do, I have to make	3
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.	3
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.	4
What are you doing?	2
Storming out!	4
Rachel, this is your apartment.	0
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!	4
These little women. Wow!	2
Your liking it, huh?	0
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.	1
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.	0
Chandler.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
Joey.	0
Hey-hey!	1
Hey.	0
This is Monica.	0

And this is Rachel.	0
Hi!	1
Whoa!!	2
I'm gonna get coffee.	0
We don't, really.	0
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?	0
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.	0
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.	0
I know.	0
Okay, Chandler!	0
Okay.	0

Hey!!	1
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!	2
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?	1
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!	1
No! Joey, you're going to be great!	0
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology!	5
I'll be waiting.	0
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.	2
I know!	2
There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.	0
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.	3
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.	0
Okay!	1
So Rach!	1
You're the first guest at Hotel Monica!	1
Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.	0

Oh, you have been through so much.	3
I have.	3
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.	0
Sorry, that was wax.	0
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.	3
Yeah?	0
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.	3
But I'll still always come back, like this.	0
And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.	0
But I'll still always come back, like this.	0
He is so amazing.	1
Oh, I know. Look at him.	1
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.	0

Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here.	0
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!	1
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.	2
Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!	4
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.	4
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.	0
Fine!	4
Fine!	4
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.	0
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.	0
Oh my God!	2
Yeah.	0
Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on.	0
I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before.	3
I don't need to have a game room.	0
I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I	0
Stop it Chandler.  I'm sorry too.	3
Really?	2
Ohh.	0
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.	1
That's a great idea! We can	1
Totally!	1
We don't have to come up with this now.	0
Oh good.	1
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.	0
That's great. Good for you guys.	1
I am not high maintenance!	4
I am not a pushover!	4
You did!	4
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.	0
That does not sound stupid to me.	0
You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?	0
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.	3
Next on Ross... Uh-oh.	0
It's, uh, it's a song.	0
The laundry song that we sing.	0
Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.	0
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.	0
Why are you here?	2
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...	3
No no no... I mean,	0
What!?	2
I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date...	1
Please... go!  Just let me know if you    need a hand!	0
I think it just fell off.	0
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!	3
Rachel?!	2
Yeah.	0
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!	4
And we're not a couple of suckers!	4
I hear ya, Mugsy!	0
But look, all these rooms are fine okay?	0
Okay,	0
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!	4
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!	4
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?	4
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!	4
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?	4
What did you say?	4
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."	5
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.	0
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y'know, technically we still	0
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?	0
'Kay!	0
Can I ask you something?	0
Uhh, no.	0
Felicity and I, we're watching	0
No.	0
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?	0
Yes.	0
Thanks man.	0
Okay man.	0
But what about how much taller he is than me?	0
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know?	0
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.	2
Had the beef-tips, huh?	0
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.	0
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!	4
Oh! Thank God!	1
Hope! Hope!	1
Drake!	1
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.	1
Oh Drake.	1
Okay!	1

Okay!	1
Hi, Joey!	1

Umm, I am free tomorrow night.	0
Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.	0
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...	0
Men are here.	0
This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing	0
Hi.	0
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?	0
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.	0
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.	0
What?	2
Hey, how, how did you do that?	2
Alright, somebody.	0
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.	0
Whoooaa!	2
That's my sister.	0
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.	0
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?	2
Pheebs, what about you?	0
Oh... Milwaukee.	0
Um... Ross?	0
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'	0
No way!	2
The ride broke down.	0
Oh, Rachel.	0
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Oh, is the play over?	0
Yeah. Where were you?	0
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.	0
Nah. I kept myself busy.	0
Oh, okay, yeah.  I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.	0
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.	0
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff.	0
Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should.	0
You should, you should ask Rachel to help.	0
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.	0
Really?!	2
Hey, y'know what?	2
Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.	0
No! I do want to!	1
Oh, she does want to.	0
She does want to.	0
Yeah!	1
Wow, you have really pretty feet.	2
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.	0
Yeah.	0
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real  nice and tight.	0
So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.	2
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.	0
Oh.	0
Ow! Did you just bite me?	2
No!	2
Um, that's it.	0
No.	0
Hey!	2

One more chance Ursula, please?	3
Okay.	0
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.	0
Good deal.	1
Here you go.	0
Thank you.	0
Hi!	1
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!	1
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.	5
Oh, okay.	0
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.	5
But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime.	5
So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.	5
Wow! Umm....	2
I dropped a cup.	0
Hello, tiny embryos.	0
Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi!	1
I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months.	1
You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there!	1
Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on.	1
Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so  Oh!	1
And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.	0
Ready?	0
We're baack!	1
Hey!	1
What are you guys doing together?	2
Joey and Janice's	0
Really.	2
Yeah, yeah.	0
We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman.	1
You have got competition buddy.	0
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.	0
I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.	0
You still can't stand her can you?	0
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.	3
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.	0
It was bat day at Shea Stadium.	0
You told him to play the boxer gay!!	2
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?	4
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.	0
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.	0
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.	0
I'm not your brother.	0
What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!	4
Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.	0
Are you kidding me?!	4
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.	0
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"	0
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?	0
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.	0
Is there something wrong?	0
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay?	0
You're hot.	0
I'm lovable.	0
Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.	0
But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.	0
Joey...	0
Oh.	0
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some!	1
Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment.	0
Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister.	0
Well, I'm off to bed!	0
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!	1
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.	1
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!	1
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk.	5
Okay?	0
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!	2
Oh, Joey! Sorry!	2
They made you head of the department!	1
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm	0
Yeah.	0
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?	0
Uh, Paul's Café. They got great food and it's really romantic.	0
Ooh, great! Thanks!	1
Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the	0
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya	0
Ooh, I miss dating.	3
Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.	0
I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun!	1
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.	0
Hey, y'know what?	0
Huh?	0
Why don't I take you out?	0
What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.	2
Yes I do!	1
And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out	1
Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.	1
I'll be fun.	0
All right?	0
Hi!	1
Hey!	1
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking	0
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good	1
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!	1
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.	0
Oh screw her, that part is mine!	4
Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.	0
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.	2
I can't believe you married him.	2
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.	3
How can I?	2
Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?	3
How can I accept that...	3
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.	3
Kiss me.	1
What?	2
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?	1
The bigger half.	0
I'd like to propose a toast.	1
Little toast here, ding ding.	1
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.	1
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.	1
That's so sweet.	1
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.	1
And a crappy New Year.	1
Here, here!	1
Now, hold on!	4
Hold on!	4
Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too!	4
Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.	3
Call me.	0
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!	4
What happened?!!	2
Well, I don't know!!	2
We fell asleep! That is all.	0
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.	0
I think that would be best.	0
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.	0
Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.	3
What?	2
It’s a funny story, actually.	0
I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really  know what I was saying.	0
You fell asleep?	2
But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?	5
Irony?	2
Not a fan, alright .	0
See, here’s  the thing.	0
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go.	0
See, me, I  love Tulsa!	1
Tulsa is heaven!	1
Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go  there!	5
No no no!	5
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?	0
I’ll call you from Tulsa.	0
Hi.	0
Hey.	0
How are you?	0
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?	0
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.	0
That I was not expecting.	2
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.	0
Oh. Thanks.	0
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing	1
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.	0
I just can't believe you're in here.	2
I mean, what am I gonna do without you?	3
What do you mean?	0
Smell familiar?	0
Oh no.	5
Oh, I am so sorry.	3
No me, I am so sorry...	3
Oh my.	2
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.	5
Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.	5
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.	0
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?	0
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.	0
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.	0
Tho?	0
That's good, have a seat.	0
Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.	0
You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?	0
Can you do that for me?	0
Ok.	0
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?	0
Yes!	5
Okay.	0
All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.	0
Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!	4
Oh, Ross!	4
Let go of my hand!	4
You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!	1
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!	1
Well let's just say	0
Oo, where are the seats?	1
Uh, middle balcony.	0
You're a mean old woman.	4
It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me.	1
You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity!	1
That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!	1
That means nothing to me.  Come on!	4
: Hey.	0
: What are you doing?	0
: No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!	4
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.	3
: Oh yeah, of course you don't!	4
No.	0
: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?	4
Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?	4
Okay, I'm sorry.	3
What's this?	0
Oh right its that girl's phone number.	0
It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa!	2
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!	1
Thank you.	0
I don't know how any of these got opened?!	2
You opened them all?	2
Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!	1
Yeah. What is that?	0
Yeah. What-what did Tag say?	0
I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.	1
Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!	2
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?	0
I'm not?	2
Listen I uh   It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom.	5
Y'know?	0
So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?	1
Thank you.	0
If I can't have it you can't have it!	4
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget.	0
There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and	0
Paris?	0
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .	0
Keep talking.	0
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!	1
I love you!	1
Yes!	1
I win again!	1
Ha-ha!	1
That's like 500 bucks you owe me!	1
Whoo-ho-hoo!	1
$500 that is a loooot of electricity!	1
Whoo-ho-ho!	1
I gotta buy some food.	0
You serious?	2
Okay, get ready to owe me!	1
Okay.	0
Okay, here we go. Ready?	0
Who is that?!	2
I am brave!	5
I I am brave!	5
No-no-no-no!!	5
Can you tell me who is there please?	0
Hi!	1
Hi. Do you know what time it is?	0
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.	1
Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.	1
4:00 A.M.	0
So, can I get some candy?	0
I am sorry, but some of us have to	0
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.	3
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?	0
Um-hmm.	0
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!	2
Mm! Night Gar'!	0
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.	0
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?	0
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.	0
Well have we finished the scene?	2
Yeah! You you were wonderful.	1
As were you.	0
So I got your car, it's right outside.	0
Why? Are we done for the day?	2
That's what you told me.	0
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.	5
What about these? These look the same?	0
Definitely!	1
Not as each other!	0
Oh, then no.	0
Hey!	1
You ready?	0
Yeah.	0
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.	1
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.	1
Let me see the earrings.	0
Oh, honey, the earrings	0
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?	1
My boyfriend really does have good taste!	1
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.	0
Hm-mmm.	0
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.	0
Oh my God! Look at this!	2
Okay, but there	0
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!	4
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.	0
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.	0
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.	0
Oh my God.	2
Hello darling.	0
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.	0
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna	0
Ross, I really don't think	0
Lift!! And slide!	1
Okay, here we go.	0
All right everyone, lift!  And slide!!	1
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?	0
Another	0
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?	0
Well, I'm not gonna talk because	0
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but	3
I-I am so sorry, I'll go.	3
Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.	3
Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.	0
Yeah?	0
I found my identical hand twin!	1
Ohh, you are	0
No!	0
But she just came up here!	2
That was Joey!	0
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.	0
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.	0
Would you stop that!	4
Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?	0
She didn't feel anything for him.	0
Really?	2
Okay.	0
Good.  I should really start wearing hats!	0
I mean, why should I let them meet him?	0
Listen.	0
As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.	0
I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.	0
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.	3
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..	0
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.	0
Hey sweetie.	0
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?	0
I can't tell you. It's a secret.	0
Awww.  But still no.	0
No I'm serious, we should tell each other	0
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at	0
Oh no-no, I can't do that.	5
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.	0
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
So, Ross and I are going to	0
No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe's secret?	0
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.	0
That's right! You lose sucker!!  Please still marry me.	1
Ahhh!  Ooh, nice!	1
I'm sorry, do I know you?	0
What are you doing?	0
Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.	1
What was it for?	0
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century.	0
It's really classy!	1
Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese.	1
The next next?	0
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right?	0
But then this guy's right after him.	0
Hello!	1
They loved me!	1
Oh my God!	1
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!  Oh.  Uh, okay uh let me call you back.	2
What's the matter?	0
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!	2
Wow!	2
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.	1
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.	2
Who?	0
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames.	0
Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.	0
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?	0
Umm, no. No.	0
Yes you did! What was it?	2
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.	0
Ohh that's so sweet!	1
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time!	1
Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not.	2
Dr. Geller!	1
Burt!	1
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.	0
Okay, shoot.	0
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.	0
Okay, what else?	0
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'	0
Oh.	3
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'	0
Hey.	0
How's the maniac?	0
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.	1
Phoebe, what are you doing?	2
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.	1
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?	2
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?	2
What are you saying I should do?	0
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.	0
Thank you, Monica.	1
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.	0
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!	1
Ooh, let's see it!	1
Ahhh.	2
Ah!	2
She's not crazy is she?	2
No.	0
So uh, how you doin'?	0
There he is!	1
There's our star!	1
So, so, what'd ya think?	0
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.	1
I-I wasn't in that.	3
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.	0
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.	0
Oh, good. Thanks.	0
Now what is Fabutec?	0
Okay, all right don't judge me to much.	5
Okay?	0
Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop.	0
But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....	1
Waxine!!	2
Yes! Have you seen it?	2
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.	1
I know!!	1
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?	5
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!	1
They have the best stuff in there.	0
Comin' through. Move, move.	4
What?	2
No suds, no save. Ok?	4
What's goin' on?	0
Was your basket on top?	0
Yeah, but, there were no suds.	0
So?	0
Well, you know, no suds, no save.	0
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.	4
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.	4
'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!	4
Well, I think this is a great place to work!	1
Varrrrrroom!	1
Hey!	1
Watch it lady!	4

Joey stuffing 15	0

Where were you?	0
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.	0
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?	2
Oh, which museum?	0
No, answer his.	0
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.	1
She was totally at my mercy.	1
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.	0
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?	1
Why is your family	0
He cannot play at our wedding!	4
I mean everyone will leave!	4
I mean come on, that is just noise!	4
It's not even a song!	4
If you listen very carefully, I think its	0
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!	2
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?	0
Oh, yeah, sure.	0
I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'	0
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.	0
Yeah.	0
You see, now, I would date this girl.	0
She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.	0
I mean, that's got to come in handy	0
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?	0
I don't know.	0
Me neither.	0
Rachel.	0
What?!	2
I don't know.  Me neither.	0
Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.	3
Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.	0
Yeah?	2
Oh. Yeah.  Uh Chandler	0
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?	0
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.	2
Also an island.	0
Hey, what time is it?	0
2:17.	0
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?	2
Are you serious?!	2
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.	0
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!	2
Hey, you guys	0
Hey!	1
Who is it?	0
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!	1
Hey!	1
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.	2
And-	0
Yeah, can I help you with something?	0
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.	0
What?!	2
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.	0
No way!	4
And stop using my name!	4
Hey!	1
Hi Pheebs!	1
Are you moving out?	0
No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.	0
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?	0
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.	0
Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,	5
Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.	0
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.	0
Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!	2
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.	2
Which proves that I never lie.	0
I guess you don't.	0
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.	5
I'm not freaking out.	0
Why would I be freaking out?	0
A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.	0
I mean, what's the harm in that?	0
Okay.	0
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready	0
I know! I know.	0
Okay.	0
Hey, did she buy it?	0
Totally.	0
So did Heldi show you the place?	0
Yeah, it's beautiful.	0
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!	1
I know.	0
No Phoebe!	4
You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair!	4
Okay look, I have an idea.	0
Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.	0
And then whoever does gets the phone.	0
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.	0
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.	4
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.	0
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.	3
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.	3
Yes okay.	0
Joe.	0
Carlos.	0
Peter.	0
Ooh!	2
Peter Luger!	2
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.	0
Oh, I win! He's got	1
So you don't know that's	0
His new girlfriend!	2
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?	2
And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to	0
Well what happened at dinner?	0
My God! What did you order?!	2
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!	3
Honey, it's gonna be okay.	0
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!	3
No, y'know what?	0
It's gonna be okay.	0
I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast.	0
Y'know?	0
And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.	0
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.	0
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.	0
I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.	0
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.	0
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.	0
Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division.	3
Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.	0
I'm Ross!	1
I'm divorced, and I have a kid!	1
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!	1
All right, there you go!	1
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.	0
I'm Rhonda,  and these aren't real!	0
Wow, Rhonda.	2
I'm Scott.	0
Yeah, okay, Scott!	0
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.	5
So thanks for the warm welcome.	0
It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.	1
I hope you do too.	0
Now, let's go out there and get 'em!	1
Huh?	2
And remember, there is no 'I' in team.	0
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody	1
No-no, I heard what you said, funny.	0
I like funny.	1
This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun.	1
Good to have you aboard Bing!	1
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.	0
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?	0
They're gonna call her Chandler.	0
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?	0
Works on you.	0
Oh, that is so sweet.	1
No, no, ok, you hang up.	1
Ok, ok, one, two, three.	1
Well you didn't hang up either.	1
She didn't hang up either...	1
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-	1
Ross, hi, it's Rachel.	0
I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your	0
Rach, I got a message from you.	0
Oh my God.	2
.	0

You're over me?	2
Ohhhhhhhh God.	2
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?	2
When, when were you... under me?	2
OK, I need to lie down.	2
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!	1
Really? That's great!	1
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her	1
(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of	0
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?	0
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.	0
That really was some of your best work.	1
I have to be up in seven minutes.	0
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes	0
Really?!	2
Do you wanna?	0
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!	1
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.	0
Boyfriend?	2
No.	0
I'm Joey.	0
Kristen.	0
Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?	1
Kristen.	0
Got it!  So	0
So uh, do you live around here?	0
Yeah!	0
Yeah!	1
Right down there.	0
Hey listen; let me give you a little tip.	0
I'll remember that.	0
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?	0
Oh I, I have plans tonight.	0
Oh.	3
But how about tomorrow?	0
Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?	1
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.	0
Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, I'll grab this one.	0
Hey.	0
Listen, um...	0
I'm sorry.	3
: Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'	0
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.	0
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?	0
You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.	3
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.	0
Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.	3
I could've been killed I hope you know!	4
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were	3
Phoebe.	0
What?!  What the hell?!	4
All right, y'know what?	4
If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.	4
What?! Why?!	2
Because! Because, it-it-it's  It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar	4
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.	4
I was going to tell you, but	0
But what?! You figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!	4
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just   Why don't we just let the machine get that?	4
Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.	0
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh!	1
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.	0
You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I'll be living here.	1
Why did you take the shower curtain down?	2
That thing was a hazard!  I'm very safety conscious.	5
Hi.	0
Hey man, how did the audition go?	0
Estelle said I didn't get it.	3
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!	2
No!	2
For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around.	0
No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.	0
Right here.	0
Well, it's getting late.	0
Yeah, we're gonna go.	0
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?	0
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.	0
Yeah, it's a very large plane.	0
That's cool.	0
But, we'll stay here with you.	0
Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.	1
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.	2
They're not a couple!	2
Oh-okay, I get the game now.	0
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?	0
Oh yeah!	1
Well okay, so then you're fine.	0
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.	0
Okay?	0
So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.	0
It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.	0
Really?	2
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?	0
No.	0
Noooo!!	0
Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!	2
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.	0
Wait a second! So, what's new with you?	2
Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.	0
And your breasts! Hmm!!!	2
Okay.	0
But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.	0
So, why don't we just start over okay?	0
And you can just tell me about yourself.	0
All right.	0
Okay.	0
I write erotic novels, for children.	0
What?!	2
They're wildly unpopular.	0
Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.	0
Wow! You do?	2
Yeah,  a Pretty Huge	1
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.	3
What?	2
What's different?	2
Nothing.	0
Oh, maybe that's it.	0
Okay, relax, relax.	0
We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.	0
Oh God!	2
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.	0
Oh!	2
Oh, you know what I loved?	1
Her Sweet 'n' Los.	1
How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.	1
Not just restaurants, from our house.	0
Maybe.	0
You can't!	2
Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.	2
In the hall.	0
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.	0
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.	0
Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.	0
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.	0
That's a good one!	1
Hey, Joe.	0
Dad, Ronni's here.	0
Huh?	2
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal.	0
Anything at all.	0
But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.	0
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.	1
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!	4
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.	0
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?	0
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?	1
Okay, you're fine.	0
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!	2
You'll see.	0
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles	0
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and   You go.	0
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time.	0
Really, it's fine, whatever you want.	0
It's perfect.	1
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.	3
Coming.	0
I have a bone to pick with you.	4
Uh-oh.	5
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old	2
That's right! That's right!	1
Oh that.	0
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!	4
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!	4
Okay.	0
And if it were true, how	0
Ms. Monroe   Oh there you go.	0
Mark's a genius!	2
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?	2
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.	0
What am I going to do?	5
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.	0
All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.	0
I don't know you guys.	5
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.	0
Great. Great.	0
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.	0
I'll be there.	0
Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.	0
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!	0
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of	0
Hey guys, what are you doing?	0
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.	0
Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.	0
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.	0
Well, Chandler will be there for you too.	0
I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there.	0
And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.	0
What do ya say? What do ya say?	0
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.	0
But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.	0
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!	2
What's that supposed to mean?	2
Nothing! It's an expression.	0
No it's not.	0
Don't listen to your mother.	0
You're independent, and you always have been!	0
And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...	0
PBS Telethon.	0
Hi Joey.	0
Hey Pheebs!	1
I	0
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what	2
What kind of problem?	2
Oh my God!	2
I don't have to give up the bag!	4
Oh, you think I should give up the bag!	4
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it	0
Oh, hey!	2
I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.	0
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.	0
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.	0
Okay, great.	1
They say he's only got half a tank left.	0
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!	2
What? Why?	2
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.	4
Uh-huh.	0
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!	4
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!	4
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?	2
Hey!	1
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.	2
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.	1
Well, I'm very glad you're here.	1
Oh, you're such a gentleman.  Come on! We're going to my place!	1
Hey!	1
Hey-hey.	0
So are guys doing okay?	0
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.	0
Do you have a minute?	0
Well yeah, sure, what's up?	0
Oh really?!	2
Why's that?	0
I don't think I should say.	0
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.	0
Okay.	0
'Kay.	0
Well	0
Yeah.	0
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.	0
Yeah, she's gay.	0
Here you go.	0
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.	1
Great!	1
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?	2
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.	0
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.	2
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.	0
What?	2
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!	2
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?	2
But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.	0
You got all that from the back of her head?	2
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.	0
Who's Elaine?	0
So, will you talk to him?	0
I don't know Rach.	0
One!  No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!	4
Hey!	1
Hi!	1
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?	0
We need a porn break.	0
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.	0
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.	0
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.	1
Hey!	1
Hi!	1
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked.	1
Now, I know what you're thinking	0
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?	2
Are you sure?	0
No!	4
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.	0
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.	0
What's the second part of your plan?	0
Yes that's right.	0
Why?	2
I tired attacking two women, did not work.	0
What?!	2
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends.	0
Oh, no!	2
No-no!	2
No, I tired!	2
But I couldn't.	0
Maybe we could attack them together?	0
That-that's a no.	0
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!	4
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!	4
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.	0
I like that.	1
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.	0
Huh?	0
One swift kick and he'll back off.	0
All right, bad ankle, got it!	0
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.	0
Yeah.	0
And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.	0
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!	1
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.	0
I don't care! You just get him!	4
I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!	1
The Red Ross! Okay.	1
Oh!  Oh by the way?	0
Uh-hmm.	0
James Brolin?	0
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.	0
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.	0
Really?!	2
Hello?	0
Hello, is Ross there?	0
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?	0
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.	0
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!	2
Whoa!!	2
Oh!	2
Wow that was a big one.	2
Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya.  What uh-How come you're not going?	0
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.	0
I thought you already have a job.	0
And people say you don't pay attention.	0
No, this is a much better job.	0
It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.	0
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!	2
That's what I do now.	0
Hey Joey, come taste this.	0
What is it?	0
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well   I'm getting my revenge!	4
You cooked him?	2
No.	0
He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.	0
Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!	1
"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."	1
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?	0
We're never gonna find anybody.	3
Well then let me do it!	1
Look, I've been thinking about it.	0
I'm an actor right?	0
So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.	0
Y'know?	0
Everyone knows I'm an ass man!	1
That is true.	0
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.	1
It'll be me!	1
And I swear I'll do a really good job.	1
Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.	1
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.	0
It might be kinda cool.	1
So I can do it?	1
Ah-ha! Too cocky!	1
Of course I do! And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.	0
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?	2
You said there was a gas leak in here.	0
Well why don't you use your key?	0
Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.	0
If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.	0
Come on!	4
Oh! We could have done that.	0
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.	0
Oh, I'm so sorry.	3
I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.	0
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?	2
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.	0
(walking up with this	0
Little girl misses her cat.	0
Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.	0
Yeah.	0
Thank you.	0
I	0
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.	0
You think?	2
Oh-no, he's right.	0
Seven hundred bucks!	1
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?	1
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?	0
Oh.	0
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.	0
Me too.	0
Although this city is my home, so.	0
So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that.	0
Umm, you make something up.	0
Nice,  thank you.	1
This is me.	0
Here.	0
Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!	1
He would like to kiss you.	0
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now.	0
Not him, you don't!	2
Well the moment's over.	0
Oh.	0
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.	0
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.	0
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.	2
Oh, you want something serious.	0
Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.	0
Those are dead serious.	0
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.	5
Why not?!	2
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...	0
What?	2
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.	3
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.	2
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.	1
How are you feeling?	0
You are	0
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?	0
Then we can put you in bed, okay?	0
Just smile and don't talk to	0
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?	1
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!	1
Speech! Come on Monica!	1
Come on!	1
Come on! Speech!	1
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.	1
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.	0
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was the first time I knew that you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.	1
All right.	0
The super couldn't figure out what it did.	0
Thank God.	1
He doesn't have anyone.	0
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!	1
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.	0
You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.	0
Y'know, we don't have to watch this.	0
Exactly.	0
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!	1
I love her books!	1
I cannot get on a plane without one!	1
I mean, this is so cool!	1
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.	1
Thank you.	0
And a nice hot cider for Monica.	0
Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?	0
Yeah?	0
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?	2
Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!	2
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?	0
Yes?	0
Yeah I can, it worked real well.	0
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.	4
I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.	4
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!	4
What?!	2
Who are you talking too?	2
I am	0
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!	4
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.	5
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!	0
Shh! Get me out of here.	5
Oh.	0
Ross!	2
What?	0
Come here, check this out!	2
What? Is it the comet?	0
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.	2
Y'know, there's	0
Show me where?	0
Right-right up here.	0
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?	0
Joey!	4
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid	4
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!	4
Oh no! No! No!	2
Wow! This place is incredible!  Sting's pen that he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!	1
Hi!	0
Hi!	0
I'm Trudie.	0
Uh-huh.	0
You must be Ben's mum.	0
Why else would I be here?	0
Do sit down.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh Rach that's great. That's great.	1
Hi.. how was the game?	0
Well..	0
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!	1
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?	2
Alan.	0
He was unbelievable.	1
He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...	1
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.	1
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..	1
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..	0
What?	2
..I dunno, a little too Alan?	0
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.	1
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade,	1
What the hell!	2
Okay.	0
All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?	0
My God!	2
These pants are burning up!	2
Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!	2
It's like a volcano in here!	2
Are you hot?	0
Okay, it must just be me then.	0
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?	0
You're driving me crazy with that!	4
Okay, I'll stop.	0
You wanna play?	0
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.	0
And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.	0
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.	0
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?	1
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.	0
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?	0
Uh yeah, right here.	0
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?	1
What's that?	0
Weeeell, it's rum, and-	0
I'm sure they'll be here soon.	0
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.	0
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.	0
You are really frightening me.	5
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?	5
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.	0
All right, honey, time to start pushing.	0
But they're not here yet!	5
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.	0
Oh, god.	5
Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.	0
And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.	1
Okay.	0
I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun.	0
So where-where is it going?	0
Ah!	2
That's-that's the real question.	0
And-and the answer is is it's going somewhere fun.	1
Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger.	0
No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you	5
Y'know what?	0
I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.	1
I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .	1
Really?	2
They taste so good.	1
Drum roll.	0
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?	0
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.	0
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.	0
You're actually going through with this?	2
Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women  So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.	0
All right, this has got to stop!	4
Chandler is a great name!	4
I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.	0
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!	2
It was.	0
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.	3
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?	2
No.	0
Whoa. That was really good.	2
Thanks, any suggestions?	0
You-you you had sex with Ursula?!	2
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and	5
You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!	2
I don't want to lose you!	5
Hey!	1
Hi.	0
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?	0
Manhattan does not have enough stores.	3
Well,	0
You can?	2
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.	0
Um-hmm.	0
And a small piece of chocolate.	0
Okay.	0
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship	3
Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?	2
No! No! Not, Paris.	0
Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?	1
I don't know exactly.	0
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.	3
Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that's him! That's him!	1
Great! Go get him.	1
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.	0
He's not really my type.	0
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.	0
But you said he was this great guy!	2
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.	3
You do attract some stinkers.	3
Chandler.	0
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a	0
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.	0
Oh, listen.	0
If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.	0
Nothing at all.	0
Nothing.	0
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?	0
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?	0
I can get out, "Joey, I have too " but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, " go to the bathroom."	3
He may think I'm sick.	0
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I  We just have to get it over with!	0
Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them.	0
Okay?	0
That's it.	0
Pretty much.	0
All right.	0
Hey Monica!	1
Hi!	1
Hey man, you feeling any better?	0
Joey, we have something to tell you.	0
Oh my God! You're pregnant!	2
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.	0
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.	0
Really?!	2
Yeah!	0
Oh my God!-Eh! Well	2
He's gonna go up to the counter with	0
Yeah.	0
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?	0
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!	1
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.	4
We will.	0
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.	0
No Mon,	0
Every year.	0
And	0
Hey! Ross!	1
Die Hard	0
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?	0
What'd you rent?	0
Die Hard 2	0
Joey, this is	0
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its	0
Joey, we	0
And?	0
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!	1
Die Hard	0
Dude, you didn't say	0
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.	0
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.	0
I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.	4
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!	1
Stop going through my stuff !	4
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.	5
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!	4
And I can't stop you.	0
No.	0
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?	0
I'm smarter than	0
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.	1
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.	0
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.	0
No.	0
No, thank you.	0
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.	0
I'd love an ice water.	0
You got it.	0
Joey, what are you doing?	2
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?	0
Joey, do you work here?	2
No.	0
Hey, waiter.	0
Yeah?	0
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening.  Yeah we are.	0
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.	0
I'm calling for Monica Geller.	0
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available	0
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!	2
Thank you.	0
Thanks.	0
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am	0
So go fix it!	0
Go find Chandler!	0
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!	1
Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!	1
Anybody lose this?	0
Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!	1
Hmm.	0
Do you remember where the duck food is?	0
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?	2
Because I'm going to London.	0
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?	2
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.	0
Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.	0
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.	0
Ohh-Do you think he will?!	2
Y'know, it's too late!	4
You missed you're chance!	3
I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.	3
So is everybody here?	0
I got here a little early myself.	0
Let us begin.	0
Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.	0
Here.	0
Here.	0
Now as for the hydrosaurs	0
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.	0
I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry.	3
So, do you think you can forgive me?	3
Great.	1
Thanks.	1
Okay, bye.	0
Hello, Jennifer?	0
Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?	2
Oh, she's not home huh?	2
Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.	0
Hi.	0
Are you all right?	0
Uhh... I think I just got engaged.	5
Oh my God! He did it?	2
Are you kidding?	2
I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.	0
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.	2
Really?! Even Ross?	2
Especially Ross!	1
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later.	0
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just...I’ll  come back.	2
There he goes, your fiancée.	1
I guess so.	0
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.	0
I can’t say that I’m surprised.	0
Oh, that is so unfortunate.	3
What?	0
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.	0
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.	0
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.	0
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.	0
I think on some levels she already knows.	0
Night Mon. Night Julio.	0
Adios.	0
Look Julio, someone left their book here.	2
Ah actually, that is mine.	0
Oh yeah, what are you reading?	0
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?	0
Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?	0
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.	0
Your a poet and don't know it.	0
Actually I ah, I am a poet.	0
Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?	0
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.	0
Mine?  Right here?	0
I can write an epic poem about this lip.	1
How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.	1
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.	0
What?	2
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.	0
What?	2
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?	0
Are we really in Montreal?!	2
Yes we are. So, coffee?	0
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.	0
Okay, here's batch 22.	0
This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.	0
Let's give it a shot.	0
Okay. Man, I have	0
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?	2
No, just a Friday night.	0
Would she?	0
Would she?  You ate my candy bar!	4
I know honey, I'm sorry.	3
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.	3
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't....	3
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?	4
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....	5
It's not funny, this is actually my job.	4
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.	0
Ah, just one other thing.	0
I ah, I work at	0
Do you want my pickle?	0
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?	0
Why?	2
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.	0
Oh my God.	2
Phoebe.	0
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.	1
We should do something. Whistle.	1
Come on, do it.	0
Do it!	1
Do it do it do it!	1
Woo-woo!	1
I can't believe you did that!	2
Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.	0
Still?	2
Either eat it, or be in it.	4
Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?	0
I can.	0
Okay, go ahead.	0
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.	0
That's very good, what's your name?	0
Monica.	0
Monica, you go to the head of the class.	0
Okay.	1
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.	0
But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.	0
Humaaan spleeeeen.	0
Olè!	1
What are you doing here!	2
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!	1
Great!	1
Yeah!	1
It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!	1
Yeah.	0
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...	0
But what?	0
This is kind of a classy place.	0
Ok, say no more.	0
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.	0
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention	0
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?	0
I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...	0
Kate Miller?	0
Kate Miller it is.	0
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?	0
Thank you.	0
Oh my God!	2
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.	3
No. No, you're not a loser.	3
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!	1
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.	1
Yeah!	1
That really is something; that's really cool.	1
Howdy partner!	1
Maybe I should get another pair!	1
Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.	1
I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.	1
I would make a good cowboy.	1
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.	0
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.	0
Oh yeah!	2
Great nap.	0
It really was.	0
So, let's talk about women. I'm sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.	0
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"	0
Hey, how you doin'?	0
Hey Mikey	0
Hey P	0
What are you doing?	0
Setting rat traps.	0
To kill Bob??	2
No, no, to test his neck strength.	0
Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.	0
I'll find Bob, I'll get him.	0
Bob?	5
Oh - Oh my god!	2
Bob    had babies!	2
Bob's a mom!	2
I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.	0
I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...	0
Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.	0
Suzie?	0
Hmmm, soup!	1
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?	0
Oh yeah, no problem.	0
Thanks.	0
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.	3
Joey!	2
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!	2
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!	4
So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.	4
I said, "No!"	4
Which puts	0
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?	2
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.	0
What?! Why?!	2
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and	0
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's	0
Do-do you, do you have brothers?	0
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.	0
Are you close with them?	0
No-no, they're not very nice people.	0
Okay, listen, I really like you.	0
Okay?	0
I think this can go somewhere.	0
So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?	0
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of	0
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!	0
What?	2
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.	0
I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head.	0
Anyway, she didn't want to stay.	3
I called a cab; she just left.	0
I wrote you a letter.	0
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.	1
It's just some things I've been thinking about.	0
Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.	0
Okay.  Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning.  So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.	0
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.	0
Well, you said that we except the	0
All right, that I'll retract.	0
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.	4
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?	2
Lebanon.	0
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.	0
Okay, then what happened?	0
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?	0
Nothing!   This is not over!	4
No! No! No!	4
What?!	2
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?	0
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.	3
Really?	2
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.	3
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.	0
That's okay, Joe.	0
All right, let's go Pheebs.	0
Oh God!	2
That was amazing.	1
I know.	0
Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?	1
We may have just started a family.	1
Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.	1
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.	0
I knew it!	2
Right?	0
You didn't just break up.	0
Hey, it's been like three weeks!	4
That's Bill Clinton.	0
Who's he huggin'?	0
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?	2
We use it!!	1
There you go!!	1
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.	2
I'm not gonna go out with him.	0
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.	2
Oh yeah, sure, that too.	0
What?	0
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?	0
Well, there's this one thing  Okay,  here goes.	0
I made a promise that--Oh hey!	2
What?	0
You're nose is bleeding!	2
Oh not again!	4
This-this happened when my grandfather died.	3
Sorry.	3
Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?	0
Umm	0
Sorry. Sorry.	3
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.	3
Hello, Chip.	0
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at	1
So ah, Monica ready yet?	0
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?	0
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?	2
That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.	1
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?	2
He's talking to the baby.	0
Ohh!	2
Okay!	2
Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can't wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's a trick."	2
Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.	0
Okay.	0
Oh my, oh my God!	2
Aw, it's unbelievable!	2
Wow!	2
She is kicking so much!	2
Oh, she's like umm oh who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?	1
Mia Hamm?	0
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!	2
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!	2
Okay, what do you guys think?	0
Dude!	2
You really like it?	2
Dude! How-how did you write this?	2
I stole Monica's and changed the name.	0
You can't	0
If he goes first he can!	1
Hey!	2
Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know?	0
Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.	0
Oh wow that's a great idea! And	1
Here you go.	0
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.	1
Here you go.	0
Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler.	0
Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.	0
Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that hot dog.	0
I'm all done.	0
Thank God.	1
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.	0
Oh right.	0
Right.	0
Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried?	1
We're probably too old to do that now.	3
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.	1
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.	1
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?	2
Well I'm, I'm a little slow.  Just as our children would be.	0
Relax every muscle in your body.	0
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.	0
Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.	0
Okay, tell me your happy place.	0
Richard's living room, drinking wine.	1
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!	4
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.	0
Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.	0
All right, I'll try not to.	0
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....	0
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?	3
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....	1
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.	3
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.	0
Okay.	0
Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.	1
And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....	0
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.	0
See you later Rach.	0
Bye-bye Julie.	0
Hey.	0
Hey.	0
Hey?	0
What?	0
Can I ask you somethin'?	0
Ok.	0
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?	0
What's up?	0
F.Y.I..	0
I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.	0
Her name is Stephanie... something.	0
She's supposed to be very good.	0
But what about Phoebe?	2
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.	3
Uh...	0
Oh.	0
Are you jealous?	2
All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.	0
And y'know, and um, I...	0
Honey, I love you too.	0
What?	2
Huh.	2
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.	0
I can't believe you came back.	2
I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think.	0
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.	1
Rachel! Rachel!	1
What?	0
You missed the exit!	2
Oh, sorry.	0
My God, what were you thinking about?	2
Um,  Barry.	0
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!	2
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.	1
God!	2
Well actually, Ross doesn't.	0
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.	0
Dear Mary-Angela.	0
Hi.	0
How's it going.	0
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.	0
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person.	0
At least you know her name.	0
You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.	0
Hey.	0
Oh! I knew it! What happened?	2
What?! You kissed!	2
All right.	0
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?	0
A two and a five.	0
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!	1
Really?!	2
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again.  What do you got?	0
A four and a nine.	0
You're kidding right?	2
No. Why?	0
Well that's a full cup!	2
Damn! I am good at Cups!	1
What? Why? Where are you?	2
I'm still on the set!	0
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!	4
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?	0
Yeah, I've been around.	0
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?	0
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.	0
Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees!	2
Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.	0
Great! Problem solved!	1
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.	0
Why?	2
Bastard!	4
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh!	2
All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!	2
Oh!	2
Oh, I can't believe it!	2
I mean I think it's great!	1
For him.	0
She might be able to do better.	0
Hey guys!	0
Joey! Come here! Come here!	0
What? What?	2
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.	0
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?	0
No. Joey, she	0
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?	2
Yes, but y'know what?	0
It doesn't matter who knows what.	0
Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!	0
Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!	1
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.	0
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.	0
You really think it would be that different?	2
How could it not be?	2
I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.	3
And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a	3
Well, things change.	0
I don't want them to move to a	3
It'll be okay Joe.	0
Its still there!	2
Mrs. Braverman must be out.	0
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.	5
No that could kill her.	5
Well, we don't want that.	0
No, so we're protecting her.	0
But we should take it.	0
Why?	2
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!	5
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?	0
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.	0
Well, you're gonna.	0
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...	0
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?	0
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.	0
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...	0
Hey, you're not him.	0
You're you.	0
When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?	0
No.	0
No.	0
You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.	0
And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."	0
Yeah. I really do.	0
Thanks, Chandler.	0
Hi.	0
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?	0
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?	0
And the cream?	0
Cheese makes me thirsty.	0
Okay. Let's move on.	0
All right.	0
Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?	2
Oh no!	2
I don't know anything about cooking.	0
I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.	0
Well, hats off to the chef.	1
I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?	0
The chef!	1
That's right.	1
Hey, Pheebs.	0
Hey.	0
How's it going?	0
So what's going on?	0
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.	0
I dunno, there's just something about...	0
Basically we just feel that he's...	0
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.	3
Uh-huh.	0
Okay.	0
Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?	0
We're sorry.	3
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
What are you doing?	0
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.	0
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!	4
All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.	0
And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.	0
!	2
She said what?	2
She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."	0
This isn't right.	0
Don't you point your pants at me!	4
We have no choice!	4
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.	0
No. I'm saying it's now.	0
And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!	4
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-	3
Hi, honey.	0
See you later.	0
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!	4
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.	0
Oh no!	2
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available	0
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!	2
NOOOO!!!!!!!!	4
Ma! What're you doing here?	2
I came to give you this  and this.	0
Oww! Big ring!	2
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.	0
Yeah, yeah, all the time.	0
Really?	2
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.	0
Check this out. Can I have this?	0
What?	0
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.	0
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.	0
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.	3
Fortunately, it is me.	1
And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.	1
Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.	1
Y'know, someplace nice.	0
Yeah, someplace nice.	0
Yeah!	1
So, what do you think?	0
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.	1
I know!	1
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?	0
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!	1
Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!	1
What's this?	2
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.	0
Gotcha.	0
This place is really my Grandmother's.	0
I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.	0
So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR.	0
So are you thirsty?	0
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
Hey!	1
How was your first day?	0
Ohh, okay.	0
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.	1
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.	0
Hey, ready for dinner?	0
Ooh, absolutely!	1
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?	1
Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.	0
How about Mama Lisettie's?	0
Enh. Sure!	0
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!	0
That-this milk is mine.	0
I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.	0
Okay, let's go!	1
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.	0
Okay, stop!	4
Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?	0
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.	0
Go!	0
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!	1
I know. I'm sorry.	3
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.	0
Yeah.	0
God, what a mess.	0
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.	0
Well, I lost.	3
Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.	3
Hey! How'd the interview go?	1
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.	3
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.	3
That's not how that was supposed to come out.	3
This is the worst Christmas ever.	3
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.	0
I can't!	4
It's too late!	4
Terry already hired that girl over there.	3
Look at her, she's even got waitress experience.	3
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.	3
That word was swans.	0
What do we got there?	2
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture-Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!	2
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.	1
It's all right.	0
It's all right.	0
You don't have to explain.	0
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.	0
You're our third call tonight.	0
Really?	2
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.	0
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.	3
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.	0
Thank God. Food.	1
Phoebe?	0
What?	0
Do you have a plan?	0
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'	2
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?	2
Oh God.	2
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!	2
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?	0
Big Bird's friend.	0
I see pizza!	1
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!	1
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?	0
What?!	0
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.	1
Allll done!	0
Aww, thank you.	1
Okay, who's next?!	0
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.	0
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for?	2
What, like a number?	0
Hi! Bye!	0
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.	0
Ooh, very official.	0
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.	0
And who laminated it?	0
That would be me.	0
All right let me see.  Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?	0
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.	0
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the	0
Hi! And you're going into what grade?	2
Shh!	4
Doogie, shh!	4
Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon?	2
Huh?	2
Go little boy, go!	4
Oh cool! You made him cry!	1
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.	0
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!	4
Need some help?	0
Your license please.	0
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer Pretty?	0
It's Petty.  I'll be right back with your ticket.	0
You have a son!	2
I know. I know.	0
Uh, like, could these margaritas	0
Hello, Mr. Bing.	0
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.	1
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk	0
Sure.	0
No problem.	0
Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?	0
Petrie.	0
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working	0
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.	1
717?  Where's 717?  Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?	2
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.	0
Ross, thank God.	1
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?	2
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.	5
Yes, please.	0
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?	4
Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.	0
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk.	0
Okay?	0
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.	0
Yeah, you're right.	0
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.	3
Oh, I know.	3
I kinda feel like it's my fault.	3
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.	4
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!	4
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.	0
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.	4
I love this coat!	1
Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!	1
Remember Phil Huntley?	0
He was fine!	1
So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!	1
Oh no	5
I'd better go. (She goes and sits down in the	0
Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.	3
I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!	4
Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?	0
Rachel!	4
Okay!	4
Okay.	0
You call that a fight?	2
What happened to you two?	2
!	2
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?	0
I'm sorry.	0
But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.	0
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.	0
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.	0
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the	2
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.	0
You need to give him money.	0
Give him money? It was a joke!	2
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.	0
You've got to be smooth about it.	0
Hey, I can be smooth.	0
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.	0
Of course, sir.	0
Okay.	0
I'd better get back to my desk.	0
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.	1
My what?	2
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.	0
But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.	0
Are you serious?	2
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?	0
I can blow dry it.	0
I can put gel on it.	0
It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.	0
Is there any chance you didn't see that?	0
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?	0
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?	0
Joey, did	0
Joey,  where did you learn that word?	2
Where do you think,  Zelda?	0
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!	4
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!	2
Hey-hey, y'know what?	4
I don't care!	4
There's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica.	0
Well, I feel like a snack!	1
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.	0
Oh no thanks. I don't like	0
What?!	2
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.	3
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.	0
They're still very angry!	4
But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish.	0
You know what the Swedish people are famous for?	0
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more	0
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!	4
How did you know about that?!	2
Hi!	1
Hi!	1
Come in.	0
Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and	0
Great!	1
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match.	0
Okay, so I made up a little test.	0
Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.	0
I can do that.	0
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.	0
Fight.	0
Very good! Okay. G.	1
String?	0
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.	1
Kitten?	0
Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?!	2

No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.	0
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?	4

And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.	0
And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.	0
Can I do it to you?	0

Hold it, hold it.	0
I gotta side with Chandler on this one.	0
You or me?	0
You guys are messing with me, right?	2
Yeah.	0
Sorry to bother you but do you have the 270 textbook?	0
What's it called	0
Digital design and principles I think	0
I don't think so?	0
I could be wrong	0
Ok that's fine. I'm just trying hard to avoid paying for books	0
You don't need the boom	0
*book	0
If I do have it, I never used it	0
I mean you can use the notes	0
It tells you everything you need to know	0
That helped me more than person_0 tbh	0
Oh alright then. I really want to do well in this class because it's interesting to me	0
Like the lecture notes and the summary notes are so comprehensive and the exams are straight out of those	0
So idk if the book will help	0
Ok	0
Btw first exam is the same as first practice exam	0
Like 75% identical if not more	0
So if you get a 90%+ you should be in good shape cause the averages crash for the next 3 at a pretty steady rate	0
Everyone got hammered on the last exam last sem	0
Cause the no one knew wtf was going on for the second half of the exam	0
lmk when you get your server back up	0

I'd chip in if you make a payment plan	0
Thank yo gracious sir	1

so at one of my clients, they moved all the data (comign from all these different 3rd party vendors) into one centralized data warehouse, and then I collected requirements for reports and then developed them	0
Hmm and you go on site to do those things	0
the reports would be used by the sales reps (it's a pharma company) hwen they're on the field, to have information they need immediately, when they're trying to sell products to doctors/clinics/hospitals/etc.	0
yeah	0
Oh okay gotcha, so is there programming involved with the data analysis	0

It's the norm of the residual	0
The eqn is in the book. It's a sum	0
Oh at each iteration no, you recalculate the residual based	0
On that iteration	0
Oh I see I see	0

Also	0
Do u think we can use a normal magnet ?	0
I am thinking as to how can we detect if the stick is vertically up or down ????	0
When those people came to give demo that day, do u remember we asked them how they detected if the stick was vertical	0
maybe a marker at one point in the stick and at one point in the bob	0

yeah I don't really like it after watching a lot of gameplay	3
what's up with your rating of sausage party? I heard good comedy in it	2
i walked out after like 40 minutes. Both me and person_77 laughed like two times at puns and that was it. I just felt like it was trying wayyyyyyyy too hard to be dirty and sexual and it made every cuss word and sex joke come out forced. Ill probably watch it again while drunk and maybe I'll like it and finish it hah. Sucks cause I was really excited for it and I love person_78 movies. But the first half hour just seemed like one joke stretched far too long hah.	3
I love person_79 as a voice and acting but I'm not too fond of his improv comedy	3
I mean I'm in the minority cause its getting good reviews. So idk I may see it again and have a few drinks and see it with different people. Cause person_77 usually doesnt like person_78 so that could have rubbed off on me. And yeah like I loved the interview and this is the end and pineapple express. I've never seen his improv.	0
Hey u have the lease right?	0

I mean BT has alot of good marchups	0
It doesn't have very many band ones due to large handsize and Vert	0
hey guys if you don't mind changing topics because this one is a little bit too vague, i came up with another idea and have an initial diagram_1 sketched out	0
so the user of our Database would be somebody who analyzes university acceptance statistics	0
in the database will be students, sports they played, high school, and college they attended	0
so the analyst can find trends like how many students that go to organization_20 have an test_1 higher than score_1	0
or how many students that go to organization_26 play golf	0
i'm in and if y'all are i'll get started on redoing part A	0
and get started on part B b/c i think it'd be great if we had the bulk of those two done tonight	0
i'm starting to put the diagram_1 on lucidchart so part B will be easy once we're done with that	0
sorry to make your guys' meeting last night go to waste. i just don't think we had a clear idea of what we were trying to do with the last topic	3
we're that couple now	0

i mean i dont think it would cover rent	0
wait not 1000 the whole summer	0
like 500/person/month	0
how much are bills?	0
its def less than a few hundred r	0
i mean we can charge them plus utitilies so they dont go crazy on ac	0
so it would just be comcast which is like 50/month	0
its def more than barely covering it	0
Yeah why don't we only charge amount_1 utilities	0
Or amount_2	0
Idk 	0

i'm glad routers are so secure	1
:p	1
(netgear routers have a vulnerability where you can get to a root console on the router just by being able to connect to the network)	0
oh yeah that's not a windows word	0
all mac/linux computers have a root account, which is like an administrator or SYSTEM user on windows	0
with netgear routers like mine, having the wireless password lets you get into a command prompt signed in as root	0
which normally takes a different username and password	0
Oh ok	0
anyway i'm gonna go set up port forwarding and give you an IP for today	0
i'll bring it over tomorrow	0

you're a selfish cunt for doing it	0

philosophy	0
ya	0

or whatsapp	0
I didn't know okay	0
so you want me to just make come up with prices for the 3 rooms?	0
the one with the guitar in the picture is gonna be the double right?	0
Yeah I'm just trying to see if there's a consensus for their value. I think it's also a good idea to meet sometime before the end of before the end of the semester to talk it out too.	0
yea ok	0
I was actually talking about the other room with the giant bed in it	0
When we were there they seemed about the same size, just one had a giant bed	0
mk	0
The guitar room might be slightly bigger, but it's kind of a dumpy room. We wanted to give the double people the best room. We could decide instead to make the other the double. We just wanted to have one picked out as the double now so it can be factored in when evaluating.	0
Ok, well i actually like the small room best but since the other one is bigger it should prolly be valued higher, so maybe price_1 for the double room, price_2 for the small room, and price_3 for the guitar room	0
Ok thank you for the input	0
Oh you finally bought yourself a bed for my place? Sweet, welcome to the organization_77. [:	1
That means I can have your sheets right?	0
And back to ignoring you.	0

this one chick has a good current profile picture	0

Just finished asking people about them haha	0
Woo!! Yayayay :)	1
Apparently a Senior organizes an order every year.  I don't know who is doing it this year but it looks like you could just get in on the order!	0
No worries about not having enough; I just had no idea they order them every year	0
Ohhh gotcha gotcha	0
Lmk who to venmo and I'll do it ^_^	0
will do :)	0
How's your day been?	0
ok	0
uneventful	0
I know you don't want to, but are you gonna look at your letter at all today?	0
Yeah	0
I'll eat lunch first	0
Pbtttt it's four	0
(I know it's late :p)	0
kk I'll try. Cuz idk this chick at all. I see her every day_1 day_2 when I catch the bus to school tho.	0
Just start with small talk	0
Say nice things	0
Maybe get her FB/number	0
The important thing is keep the conversation flowing	0
Like ask her what department she's in or something. Be like oh I see you everyday at this stop, im person_378, what's your name?	0
first things first. how to approach her. do I like just randomly go up and talk or should I be like oh hey would it be cool if I sat here.	5
If it's at the stop, just walk up to her and be like hey I see you every T-Th, do you go to the same school as me?	0
*Tues-Thurs	0
Not the crying face	0
Well she gets on at the stop after mine	0
Then talk to her when she gets on	0
Just say the same thing	0
Just don't act nervous, people don't really care if you just walk up to them and talk assuming you aren't a creep or are soliciting	0
Like I talked to the lady on my flight to location_17 for like 5 hours before I passed out	0
Oh wow. I guess I could introduce myself and shiz. I just don't wanna make it seem awkward someone just randomly coming up and talking to you.	5
If you think that way it all becomes awkward	0
Just make it natural	0
You can learn enough from the small talk usually to keep things going	0
You just have to be yourself	0
Talk how you normally would to me, person_379, family, other friends	0
oop. tomorrow	0
ohhhhhh I think I misread your message heh. Did you mean dinner today and info session tomorrow?	0
*interview	0
my brain is mush right now	0
Well the interview thing is just 30min so maybe we could do it today?	0
Before dinner?	0
mm ok. I told person_187 I'd get dinner with him tonight but maybe I can meet up with him after?	0
Oh lol hold on I'm kinda confused :P	2
So ur having dinner with person_496?	2

Ohh lol brb	0
haha kk. sorry for da confusion	0

I mean, he only wears pants. Did you sleep with yours off?	2
Depends on the weather, usually I just wear underwear but sometimes nothing feels good	0
But it was more of a joke about the both of you sleeping with your clothes on	0
Being naked doesn't have to be sexual	0
You just have to get used to it	0
What stuff?	2
It's like how I always wear a bra to sleep even though most people don't. 	0
Like sheets and blanket 	0

My parents don't want me to	0
Lol	1

OPT is good	0
Yea man	0
hmm, do you think you can convince them to be alright with that?'	0
you applied organization_36 for summer alr right?	0
Plus so much easier to earn back the money here	0
Yup!	1
Err the first time I mentioned OPT my dad was quite angry, but now I think they're kinda resigned to it lol	0
I just met person_191	1
God fucking dammit	4
How	2
He was having a smoke out back	0
Lucky sob	1
Is he as chill as he seems?	0
Yes	0
Dude I still can't believe that happened	2
I dunno, heat of the moment mang	0
When was person_194 ever in a favorable meta	0
When we had less control decks.	0
Which was?	0
Set 1-2 had DotX, set 3 had Revengers (and not enough NN support), 4 the same(but more NN support), 5 had CBD, 6 made Ahsha decent, 7 had person_195	0
I'll give you that 7 was probably the most favorable meta	0
Cause 7 allowed the deck to play defensively	0
I'm grouping the FC with 7	0
I mean FC didn't really do anything for NN.	0
G guard	0
organization_37, person_196	0
location_42 in it of itself	0
Name_1 sure I'll give you, but the crays didn't really do anything for NN either.	0
Dizmel helps lol	0
No one runs person_197 in NN.	0
location_42 fixes the entire GB2 problem	0
The fact that you have G guardians helps	0
It's not like the deck draws a shit ton	0
I think I have a solid C on it	0
(y)	0
:D	1
I need help on v0cm	0
*c0vm	0
I'm going to go drop in at person_165's for a little bit and then I'll come down to you	0
Unless you're in the cluster in which case I'll come to the cluster	0
i'm outside at the lounge	0
person_165 got a 0 on proxy so it's safe to say he's failing 213	0
person_361 and person_450 is out there doing 3d	0
Lol	1
shittyy :O	2
sad	3
:O	2
will he be fine though	0
as in academic-wise	0
Considering he failed each concepts and 150 once, he's probably going to have to do some summer classes or do a part time semester 	0
And maybe he'll have academic probation next semester	0
:O	2
 Lol okl	1
Are you walking?  	0
/which door should I meet you at    	0
There are multiple doors? I've never been to location_98	2
Yay can I see your apt	1
What didn't you come for organization_38 things?  	2
Last year 	0
Nope lol	0
And I gotta get back to work but you can come for like 10 mins lol	0
Are you walking or bussing? 	0
Walking 	0
Ok turn right at location_1 and location_2 then and I'll come meet you	0
It's one after person_199	0
We need a gift for person_200	0
Someone suggest idea	0
LoL omg yes	1
Do you have prime?	0
I do	0
But	0
that mug doesn't seem to be prime eligible	0
This does	0
nvm	0
that isn't eligible either	3
There's a normal mug that is I think	0
yeah	0
Should I get it?	0
I haven't been to uniqlo in like a week	0
i just want to buy	0
stuff	0
r u still in location_43	0
YOU COULD STILL GO	1
Yes	0
I could	0
hmmmmmmmm	0
Ohhhhhh	0
All the best person_396 ;)	1
U'll crck it bro :D	0
*crack	0
Fuck off I didn't 😏	4
I did well only daa	0
whaaat	2
u did well, but still didnt get selected? :/	2
Don't know where I would have made mistakes	0
For text classification as in? What I used for mltm?	0
Yeah	0
Actually for that we didn't use any library functions	0
We implemented it all ourselves	0
Hmm 	0
Have you worked with any libraries anyways?	0
I think svms do well on text	0
For 601, that's it	0
Hmm okay	0
Yeah on text, for classification, multiclass svm and logistic should be decent.. What's your classification problem?	0
For person_201	0
It's a 2 class classification task	0
Here we're just classifying sentences 	0
Not even documents	0
Hmmm.. So we had a similar problem for mltm, logistic regression gave 60%.. But that was 5 classes, and that was not the standard library function..	0
If it's two classes, and if you use sklearn, it'll definitely be much better	0
And you can try svms too, if your data won't be linearly separable	0
Which it probably won't since it's text	0
You can use kernels	0
Yeah that's why I guess they say generally svms do well	0
Venmo would be easier.	0
Is the chair okay though? Good for use?	0
Because I got a chair from someone and it's old and the springs have gone bad and it can't be used.	3
I wouldn't sell it if it wasn't. It just has one level	0
So you can't go up and down	0
Okay. That isn't an issue.	0
When you sit on it goes down a notch to the only level that works.	0
It works well and moves well	1
No issues	0
Alright then. That's great!	1
I have several other request too so let me know if you are having second thoughts	0
No I just wanted to confirm.	0
Okay cool.	1
I'll be home till 2:45PM	0
Dont worry I'm not into scamming people	0
Just trying to downsize	0
Haha. Okay. I'll take your word for it.	1

does anyone know if the showcase will have food (like dinner), or do I need to eat beforehand?	0
There is food, yeah. Also, you should ideally come an hour or so early for setup.	0
If you got the email from person_205, etc.	0
Actually, we have setup from 3-5 technically.	0
well, I literally just need to plug my laptop in	0
but 3-5 is the student showcase, correct?	0
You aren't an ETC person, obviously. >:o	4
We gotta theme the room.	0
uh, how?	0
That's up to us.	0
but like what do we have to work with?	0
giant inflatable chess pieces or something?	0
lol	1
Not sure. We have a sign. And cardboard. And we have to coordinate our schedules.	0
So the room is never abandoned.	0
If I were you, I'd get here early, but only maybe like time_1.	0
well, the shuttle would arrive at 4, but ok	0
Sorry, this is only the second year they've had a spring showcase, so everyone's a little unclear on what's going on.	0

But its 300 in 10 hours	0

I said I was interested	0
Cause the rest is drinking Kool aid they give you for 12 weeks	0

It tells you the point of clickbait articles without having to waste time	0
Yeah, I clicked the Grilled Cheese one	0
They spent a bunch of time talking about Boy Scouts	0
And more talking about different professors	0
Turns out grilled cheese lovers don't have better sex	2
Learn something new every day	0
I'm sorry	3

:)	1

group x schedule is out na	0
diid you check?	0

Oh I'll check	0
Well yeah And doesnt	0
Lol its funny how you're doing Or and And and how I've been doing NOR and NAND gates	1
What's that?	0
Not or and Not And	0
OH lol	1
so the values that don't fall into their range I'm guessing	0
You can do any operation using OR and AND	0
They do	0
NOR and NAND can do anything lol	0
But it's not simple like OR and AND	0
It's a boolean statement	0
Wtf	2
Like NAND and NOR have truth tables	0
So do OR and AND but it's a bit different from what you're doing	0
Oh I see	0
Interesting	0
Like it's really the same, but you're doing ranges im doing truth statements	0
You know volunteer judges have next to no power lol.	0
I mean floor judges still can make a decision	0
And provide proof	0
You're right.	0
Not much otjer than seeing it happen like I said lol.	0
But again, assuming they dont call head judge, it's usually Will right? The floor judge makes said call	0
And I know the HJ in location_45 is good. We probably have one of if not the best run regional in the world	0
But id rather contribute to making it even minorly better than playing and doing nothing at all	0
Yeah assuming they don't call HJ, it's all you. It rotates from WIll and like 1 or 2 other people. And fair enough lol	0
Plus I havent made a final decision on it yet, probably will in the next week or so. But how do I sign up?	0
Should've killed him	4
OMG LOL	1
He has boots. For movement. 	0

He's very useful. 	0
I read that 4koma	0

The one you sent to me right? It pains me that there is no lonqu esque character in fates I can ship person_486 with	3
Do you feel my pain	3
Me	0
Yea	0
Yes	0
Is person_207 not close to person_429?	0
Well in looks, definitely not. In personality, pretty close I'd say. person_430 as well. Actually person_430 is more like person_431 than person_207. person_207 is much more openly caring and well, BROTHERLY	1
But they're all different :c	3
I like person_432 a lot cuz he reminds me of person_433 from organization_80	1
But... No one is like person_429 truly...	3
Yes ma'am	0
PS I'm so stressed about being preggo again 	5

but you love germany	0
oh :C	3
person_362 hates me :C	3

oh ok good	1
but i like person_464 and he is socialist and nazis were national socialist party so therefore i am nazi	0

Kk, how much?	0
Or I could ask person_438, its his deck right?	0
He wanted me to deal with it lol but he said he wants at least 350	0
Seems steep	2
Ill think about it and get back to you lol	0
We priced it out and it over 500 lol	0
Ohhh shit	2

just that its a medical center	0
dude, choose one that you have a reason to choose	0
what reason would you have for choosing any	0
Hmm what is the whole point	0
Of the second week	0
Don't we already have our product after the first week	0
Hmm	0
Maybe to re purify it?	0
I know we need to use it to do other reactions	0
Ok	0
Yeah, that's why we leave it in the watch glad	0
Glass	0
Also	0
You put the overall transformation reaction in	0
The objective right	0
I didn't	0
Hmm yeah I think that'll be necessary two weeks down the line	0
And one more thing.. They give mass ranges for what you should add	0
Did you include the mass range and then included a blank box	0
For your mass	0
Nah, just the blank	0
Or did you just include a blank box for your mass of reagent	0
Ok	0
Yo I might send you my CU store credit to give to person_208 if I buy his GC lot	0
Nah	0

Hey person_77,/nIt is a similar room now as on the picture as the land lord decided to rent out a room downstairs first. But the pro is: it is only shared with one other person and even as big. It goes for 925$/month too. Gas, electricity, water, all kitchenstuff and furnished included	0
I made a video of the entire apartment For another girl who was interested... If you want I can send it to you or else we can organization_43 tomorrow and I show you :)	1
If you would like it then I just forward you the email address of the landlady and you can deal your move in and out and the payment with her../nUsually she asks for $200 reservation fee, that you have to provide via organization_40 for example upfront that she is sure that you take the room	0
hi! yup, it would be great if you could send that video to me (:	1
also, could i have the address of the place? bed-stuy is a bit big!	0

On google streetview you can see that there is all stuff around (fast food, deli, supeemarket close etc)	0
ok! let me check out the videos!	1
haha its very much appreciated!	1
will the landlady return the reservation fee?	0
Normaly no. I had to pat it nonrefundable	0
Pay* like my roommates	0
im on a really tight budget and im a bit worried that the additional $200 might make me go over	5
hmm	0

okay	0
And the qrop node is connected to the mantra at render?	0
Yep I've got the process mastered haha verifies, send job, python loads, opens file, fails at render	0
Do you at least get a note saying the render failed from person_222?	0
It gets stuck in an infinite loop of attempting the mantra node, then qube blocks it. Tested with a regular project file and an extremely simple ome	0
My job logs are on the network if you want to investigate	0
hmm it only has so much info. I know mine failed before when i didnt have all the directories pointing to the $HIP file	0
like everything including materials and the out images need to be $HIP and then when you submit, the $hip needs to be in the z drive	0
mine would fail if like one material wasn't formatted like that so i had to go through all of them to find the culprit	0
Had everything pointed to hip as well, same with on my mapped drive	0
even everything in the mantra node is $HIP?	2
mmhmm!	1
I checked literally everything haha	1
okay also in the qrop node, do you have the build minor thing selected	0
yes match minor allow any	0
hmmmmmm	0
e-mailed person_223 cook last night, no response. I know person_224 is getting very agitated about it so we'll see where it goes	5
are you currently in the lab? i can stop by and take a look if you have the time	0
but if its anything outside the documentation i won't be much help. I can just empathize because i too was pulling my hair out about this a few weeks ago	3
it is definitely outside documentation considering I had to text edit the config myself haha. I'm on my way to pickup a project for class at 3:30 so earliest I could try again is 4:30	0
ah no worries, im leaving around 4. but next time you're working on it I can try and help or at least see what's going on and try to communicate it to the higher ups. It's not really my job but I want people have to render farm haha	0

You found two subletters right ?	0

Mhmm	0
so basically whats happening is theyre splitting the manager role up into two things,  2 people doing strictly logistics and then 2 people doing managing campus	0
and i was considering running for the current manager role, and i talked with people and they generally recommended that I run for the logistics role (because my dancing isnt up to par where it should be), as opposed to the new campus role	0
Ah I gotcha 	0
That's tough 	3
I guess the question is, what's your reason for running? 	0
honestly i love dancing and i love working with new people	1

I'm not even sure if I can draw proper comparisons without involving like 3 or 4 other artists	0
Like Public Enemy collabing with some metal band collabing with Death Grips	0
That's okay genres are descriptions not hard labels	0
Or even some glitch/breakbeat artist	0

Interestingly enough, by default I'll be in the 10% of the graduating class by default based on program selection. They have three choices for the degree called program a, b, and c. A is a practicum aka internship (coop) that 90% of students choose. B is an independent study project which I'll probably do. And c is a thesis which I haven't ruled out.	0

location_60 looks pretty cool	0
Yeah I thought so too	0
Is that your preference?	0
Uhhh yeah. Have u been to niagra?	0
I havent been to either.	0
I have been to niagara	0
It's very cool, but very touristy	0
Lets go somewhere none of us have been before	0
I thought it was fine. It wasn't disorganized or anything and makes sense?	0
K, just wanted to make sure cuz when you write about stuff you're passionate about it doesn't always make sense	0
So I shouldn't cut out the descriptions of the characters?	0
Definitely. Like trying to fit a lot of info with the thing	0
Wait. In the intro or first few para?	0
Oh, those first few things are all part of the 'intro'	0
That's what I wanted you to look at, not just the first para	0
I think Patriots intro could be touched up because it's a little confusing. 	0
They were sexist is, I think too much of a blanket statement for person_277 and I don't know if their relationship is relevant unless it's explored later. 	0
Fair, especially because I cut the comment about how she hooks up with speed anytime something gets difficult	0
That. 	0
You have to be consistent with miss/ms america	0
Wiccan and hulking are *also* in a relationship. Not only, but also construction. 	0
I think the descriptions about their sexuality and stuff is fine though. 	0
Although maybe you can find a way for transitions to be smoother, like not just listing. 	0

I made it 21 moves before resigning	0
was he nice?	0
Oh yeah, super friendly! I'll edit the videos together later today. I did very well, actually, for the first 10 moves, and I'm annoyed with myself for losing: not because he played better, which he absolutely did, but because I lost even sooner by making dumb mistakes. I was tired by the time of the game and got excited that I was doing well, and then suddenly I couldn't think my moves out at all, and it went right down hill from there.	1
Ok, perhaps super friendly is generous. He was nice and professional though, and gave good feedback.	0
That's super cool!!	1
Yup!	1
Anyway, I feel better about playing normal games now, because I've seen I /can/ do well if I just make thoughtful, natural moves.	0

person_307	0
Didn't make any progress in comp apps	0
Thats fine	0
I can't find a O(logn) solution	0
actually	0
you shouldn't do that	0
Yeah I realized that	0
cos i don't think person_480 or person_481 will understand	0
or can explain that lol	0
It's not possible to find a O(logn) solution	0
even if you can find one	0
Because n = infinity	0
but i also don't think it's possible to find O(logn)	0
cos it's not really binary search	0
yaa	0
Yeah because it's an interval on the reals	0
I think they do big O in 110	0
Ohh but its still hard to explain it lol	0
I could write that part	0
I'm probably going to end up writing some of this anyway	0
I guess I'll just go with person_308's solution then, although I don't know the big O of findpeaks()	0
U coming today	0

going to the land of pretty the room	0
What	2
so Ive been testing it and was having all sorts of problems because they didn't give me access until last day_1. but i did a few renders and its working great for me now.	0
so if its not working for you (which you should be in the list i believe) you might have to track down the person who can put you in the list (i think its on a per user basis)	0
Interesting. I haven't even touched it, didn't have much of a reason to. Was more efficient chain rendering out of person_310 last semester, and will likely use Vray in 2017 this semester	0
I did some freelance person_222 over the summer and used cloud rendering from GridMarkets, don't know if I'll ever need the farm tbh	0
okay awesome. i haven't used much houdini recently but the rendering time was always the biggest problem	0
Yeah, the rendering in mantra takes a bit of time. 15.5 included support for outside renderers, might be worth your while to checkout octane v3	0
okay I will. also I talked to person_400 yesterday and said you guys were doing some potential architecture real-time stuff. I think i read somewhere that they recently made a vray plugin for unity so you might check on that	0
thanks for the tip. that's mostly just person_400 haha I'm doing environment design in unreal but his thesis is on archviz so I'll pass it on	0
how are things at the ec?	0
ue4, unreal engine 4	0
oh right you said that haha	0
whoah! sorry to hear that	2
very cool man, UE4 can make things look sexy as hell in real time	0
you're doing masters this year, right? 360 vid?	0
yeah, loving ue4 for speed/turnout of assets	1
i'm still a newbie at it, but i've gotten decent at texturing	0
its an area of interest still definitey but I want to focus more on programming/VR applications for the masters	0
I understand. VR has so many interesting areas to explore	0
btw what time on the 15 can i go over? i need to book my tickets to nyc (:	0
thanks!	1
well ill be moving out so it might be a bit messy but you can come over anytime after like time_1?	0
ok!	1
i'll probably take the overnight bus and go over at 9am then	0
thanks (:	1
sure no problem!	1
and person_443 still hasn't replied but I'll give you the guy person_311's context once I get it	0
sure no worries (:	1
Babe person_121	0
I'm home but TBH I'll look at your thing tmro	0
Hi	1
I love you	1
I finished assembly but idk if it'll be strong	0

er, shear strength	0
oh well	0
You'll be done soon?	0
Wanna call me?	0
Explain...? Like it feels wrong. I can't pinpoint how 	2
its saying that people are making too big of a deal out of the fact that she's a women	0
I mean. Isn't that true? Like yes and no. No I will not vote for her just because she is a woman. I will look at her policies. 	0
It's like. Partly true,  no?	0
Me (	0
*	0
it can be	0
in the subtext, it is	0
Hm... I mean, there has been talk about his implied sexism in his speeches. 	0
Why?	2
I like boy	0
a lot	0
I still haven't kissed him, I might have tried a pass today but he was sick this weekend but still coughing today	3
Hahaha ok ><	1
honestly Lord willing	0
I would love to stay here for the rest of my life LOL	1
cuz I absolutely love this company and what it stands for	1
and the company culture, etc.	1
I would absolutely love to stay at location_71	1
Oh really? 😯 I'm glad u found a place u really like! ^^	2
yes, and I actually would love stay in location_3 as long as God wants me here too	1
which is crazy, I didn't think I would be thinking this when I started back in month_1	2
Oh really? Did u think u'd look for another job?	2
I knew that person_312 would be the place to be	0
because part of me wants to go to location_72, location_73	0
part of me wants to go to location_6	0
at least, back when I started	0
now...I honestly wanna stay in location_3 as long as God wants me here as I said lol	1
I think the reason I feel this way is largely because of the new opportunity to switch from consulting to the department_1	0
oh how much time do u have?..	0
I have till time_1 ish	0
oh ok hmm idk if we'll have enough time for the interview but let's see how long dinner takes? cause the interview is only about 20min	0
and we could do the interview in the hci building - we'll have to use ur ID if u don't mind cause person_13's borrowing mine to get into 303	0
Ok! We'll figure it out 😊 will I have acces to the hci building with my ID?	1
ya all of us should :D	1
I mean the building where they teach dhcs	0
Ah ok ok 👍🏼	0
Hmm maybe. For 3c I just said the sum vector was from Neuron N because m was 0, right?	0
I think so, yeah	0
which just gives us a direction of right, correct?	0
Yea	0
That's really all I had for that part	0
alright, makes sense	0
have you been able to make any sense of this last essay thing though?	0
we'd probably just need to add the two neurons' probabilities to do bayesian inference, I imagine	0
I was thinking of using bayes theorem for one neuron and using that for the given in the bayes theorem calculation for the second neuron	0
She's been great	1
person_313 described her as aggressively affectionate this morning lolol	1
